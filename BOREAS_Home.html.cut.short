<h1>The BOREAS Project</h1>
<p>
The <b>Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study</b> (BOREAS) is a large-scale international interdisciplinary experiment in the northern boreal forests of Canada. Its goal is to improve our understanding of the boreal forests -- how they interact with the atmosphere, how much CO<sub>2</sub> they can store, and how climate change will affect them.  BOREAS wants to learn to use satellite data to monitor the forests, and to improve computer simulation and weather models so scientists can anticipate the effects of global change.

<h3>Where Was BOREAS Done?</h3>
The large-scale study area for BOREAS is a 1000 x 1000 km area covering most of Saskatchewan and Manitoba, Canada -- called the <a HREF="Study_Region.html">BOREAS Study Region</a>. Within that region are two specific study areas -- the <A HREF="Sites1/NSA.html">Northern Study Area (NSA)</A> in Thompson Manitoba, and the <A HREF="Sites1/SSA.html">Southern Study Area (SSA)</A> in Prince Albert Saskatchewan.

<h3>The BOREAS Science Groups</h3>
BOREAS has 85 science teams organized into six disciplinary groups (listed below). The 1994 and 1996 BOREAS field campaigns put over 300 scientists and aircrew into the field, supported by eleven research aircraft.

<h3>The BOREAS Field Campaigns</h3>
There were five field campaigns held in 1994 in Canada, lasting for a total of 123 days. We now have a surface-atmosphere energy flux data set supported by ecological, trace gas, hydrological and remote sensing science observations on the northern boreal forest.  The energy fluxes were measured with a network of ten towers and four flux aircraft.  Over 350 airborne missions (airborne flux and remote sensing) were flown during the 1994 field year.
