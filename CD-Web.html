<p>
<br>
The BOREAS Information System (BORIS) is in the process of creating a set of CD-ROMs to hold all of the finalized BOREAS data. These CD-ROMs will all use a HyperText Markup Language (HTML) interface -- looking and operating just like a Web site, but based on a CD-ROM (not requiring any Internet connection). In order to get some design feedback from BOREAS Investigators, we have placed the currently available files onto a Web server for people to use and evaluate.<br>
<IMG SRC="gifs/indent.gif">We invite you to browse through the following pages, see if you like the design, the indexes, the way the data files are linked -- anything. We are looking for feedback to improve the design, so if you have any comments or questions, please contact <B>David Landis (<A HREF="mailto:David.R.Landis@gsfc.nasa.gov">David.R.Landis@gsfc.nasa.gov</A>)</B>.

<B>Things to Note:</B>
<UL>
<LI>This CD-ROM Web simulation uses some JavaScript. You must use version 4 (or higher) of either Netscape or Internet Explorer to make this site function correctly.
<LI>The server for the CD-ROM Web simulation site is a bit slow. The final CD-ROMs will look and operate just like this site, only much faster.
<LI>This site does not have a complete collection of BOREAS data sets -- these are just the ones that were processed to completion first. More data sets will be added as they are compeleted.
<LI>This site is <B>password protected</B>, using the current BOREAS Data Password. If you want to get BOREAS data, and are not a BOREAS Investigator, you can go to the <A HREF="http://www-eosdis.ornl.gov/daacpages/boreas.html">ORNL DAAC site</A> to get BOREAS data.
