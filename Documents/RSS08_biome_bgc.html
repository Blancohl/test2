<H3>Summary</H3>
BIOME-BGC is a general ecosystem process model designed to simulate
biogeochemical and hydrologic processes across multiple scales (Running and
Hunt 1993). In this investigation we used BIOME-BGC to estimate daily water
and carbon budgets for the boreas tower flux sites for 1994. Carbon variables
estimated by the model include gross primary production (i.e. net
photosynthesis), maintenance and heterotrophic respiration, net primary
production and net ecosystem C exchange. Hydrologic variables estimated by the
model include snowcover, evaporation, transpiration, evapotranspiration, soil
moisture and outflow.

BIOME-BGC (BioGeoChemical cycles)
<p>
<B>1.2 Model Introduction</B><br>
BIOME-BGC simulates biogeochemical and hydrologic processes across
multiple biomes based on the logic that differences in process rates between
biomes are primarily a function of climate and general life-form
characteristics.  The carbon balance portion of BIOME-BGC utilizes daily
meteorological data in conjunction with general stand and soil information to
predict net photosynthesis, growth, maintenance and heterotrophic respiration
at a daily time-step.  BIOME-BGC is general in the sense that the surface is
represented by singular, homogeneous canopy and soil layers.  Detailed
descriptions of BIOME-BGC logic are given by Running and Coughlan (1988) and
Running and Hunt (1993).  A description of the components of the model
relating to the prediction of hydrologic characteristics within different
boreal forest stands is given by Kimball and Running (submitted).  A summary
of the important components of BIOME-BGC relating to the prediction of daily
carbon allocation and exchange is given below.
<p>
<B>1.3 Objective/Purpose</B><br>
In this investigation we used BIOME-BGC to estimate daily and annual
hydrologic and carbon budgets for different boreal forest stands associated
with the boreas tower flux sites and compared net carbon flux estimates with
results derived from tower flux and biomass measurement data. These results
were used to assess the important climate and stand characteristics that
control stand hydrologic characteristics, estimated productivity respiration
and surface-atmosphere carbon exchange. These results are intended to provide
a framework for evaluating the sensitivity of the boreal forest regional
carbon balance to global warming.

<B>1.5 Discussion</B><br>
BIOME-BGC simulates biogeochemical and hydrologic processes across
multiple biomes based on the logic that differences in process rates between
biomes are primarily a function of climate and general life-form
characteristics.  The carbon balance portion of BIOME-BGC utilizes daily
meteorological data in conjunction with general stand and soil information to
predict net photosynthesis, growth, maintenance and heterotrophic respiration
at a daily time-step.  BIOME-BGC is general in the sense that the surface is
represented by singular, homogeneous canopy and soil layers.  Detailed
descriptions of BIOME-BGC logic are given by Running and Coughlan (1988) and
Running and Hunt (1993).  A description of the components of the model
relating to the prediction of hydrologic characteristics within different
boreal forest stands is given by Kimball and Running (submitted).  A summary
of the important components of BIOME-BGC relating to the prediction of daily
carbon allocation and exchange is given below.
<br><IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">The sole input to the carbon budget in BIOME-BGC is the photosynthetic
fixation of CO<sub>2</sub> by the vegetation canopy.  Outputs are all in the form of
respired CO<sub>2</sub>, coming either from plant tissues due to growth or maintenance
respiration, or from the litter and soil carbon pools as the result of
heterotrophic respiration.
<br><IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">Gross primary production (GPP) represents the total gain of carbon to the
system by net photosynthesis and is defined as the daily sum of gross
photosynthesis and daily foliar respiration.  The current representation of
photosynthesis differs significantly from previously published descriptions of
the BGC family of models (Running and Hunt 1993, Hunt and Running 1992,
Running and Coughlan 1988).  The original FOREST-BGC representation of
photosynthesis relies primarily on the parameterization of a mesophyll
conductance to CO<sub>2</sub>, estimating the rate of fixation as a diffusion process,
driven by a prescribed internal CO<sub>2</sub> concentration.  FOREST-BGC also does not
implement an explicit treatment of the photosynthetic biochemical pathways.
The original version of BIOME-BGC presents a more detailed representation of
photosynthesis, relying on explicit models of photosynthetic biochemistry
(Leuning 1990, Farquhar et al. 1980).  The original BIOME-BGC also includes an
iterative calculation of intracellular CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (Ci), as well as an
explicit calculation of the CO<sub>2</sub> compensation point.  The current
implementation of photosynthetic biochemistry is closely related to the
original BIOME-BGC logic in that it is based on the Farquhar biochemical
model, but the resulting set of equations is somewhat different due to
differences in the logical constraints applied: we solve a quadratic system of
equations by elimination of Ci, instead of specifying a value as an initial
condition.  Other differences include a more detailed dependence of the
kinetic parameters on temperature (Woodrow and Berry 1988), and a simplifying
assumption that empirically relates the maximum rate of electron transport to
the maximum carboxylation velocity (Wullschleger 1993).
<br><IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">Photosynthesis is regulated by the canopy conductance to CO<sub>2</sub> (gc), leaf
maintenance respiration and daily meteorological conditions including air
pressure, air temperature and photosynthetically active photon flux density
(PPFD).  The maximum canopy conductance to CO<sub>2</sub> (gc,max) defines the upper
boundary of the photosynthetic rate and is determined by LAI and prescribed
leaf-scale boundary layer, cuticular and maximum stomatal conductances; gc is
reduced when air temperature, vapor pressure deficit, PPFD, or soil water
potential deviate from prescribed optimal conditions (Leuning 1990, Running
and Coughlan 1988, Jarvis and Morison 1981).  BIOME-BGC represents the canopy
as a "big leaf" in that all units of leaf area in the canopy are represented
using a single, canopy averaged conductance.  This assumption is generally not
valid at sub-daily (e.g. hourly) time-steps since the reduction of irradiance
at lower vertical layers of the canopy reduces conductances at the bottom of
the canopy.  The big leaf assumption is strengthened, however, by the
integrative effects of a daily time-step, and by the implicit assumption that
the allocation of leaf nitrogen between light harvesting and carbon fixing
enzymes over depth in the canopy varies in response to the canopy light
environment, allowing an optimized use of intercepted radiation (Evans 1989).
<br><IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">Total respiration from the system (Rtot) is estimated on a daily basis as
the sum of the maintenance (Rm), heterotrophic (Rh) and growth (Rg)
respiration components.  Rm represents the total loss of carbon due to day and
night leaf respiration (Rdl + Rnl), sapwood (Rsw), coarse root (Rcr) and fine
root (Rfr) respiration.  Respiration is estimated as a daily proportion of
carbon in living tissue that is released as the result of cellular metabolic
processes, excluding any growth processes.  Rm is calculated from mean daily
air temperatures and prescribed leaf, root and sapwood carbon pools using an
exponentially increasing function of respiration with temperature following
Amthor (1986).  The magnitude of the respiration response to temperature is
governed by a prescribed rate defined at a reference temperature (i.e. 15 C)
and a proportional change in rate for a 10 C change in temperature (Q10).  In
all cases except leaf maintenance respiration the daily average temperature is
used, and a single value is calculated for the mass lost to maintenance
respiration for the day.  In the case of leaves, however, Rdl and Rnl rates
are calculated from estimated day and night air temperatures, respectively,
since Rdl is required to determine GPP.  Daily growth respiration was not
determined explicitly by the model in this investigation; instead Rg was
computed as a proportion (32%) of the daily estimated total net primary
productivity, NPP (Penning de Vries et al. 1974).
<br><IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">The heterotrophic respiration term in BIOME-BGC represents the loss of
carbon from the system resulting from soil microbial respiration.  Daily Rh is
estimated as a proportion of prescribed soil and litter carbon pools.  The
proportion of litter carbon being respired on a daily basis is regulated by
soil water potential and soil temperature conditions following Orchard and
Cook (1983), Andren and Paustian (1987), and Running and Coughlan (1988).  The
proportion of soil carbon respired on a daily basis was estimated as 1% of the
proportion of litter carbon respired based on data for boreal coniferous and
deciduous stands (Fox and Van Cleve 1983, Cole and Rapp 1981).
<br><IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">NPP represents the net accumulation of carbon by the stand and is
determined as the difference between GPP and the sum of Rm and Rg.  The net
ecosystem exchange of carbon (NEE) represents the net accumulation or loss of
carbon by the entire soil-stand system and is determined as the difference
between GPP and Rtot.  Positive fluxes in this investigation denote a net
uptake of carbon by the system while negative fluxes denote a net loss.
Standards for denoting positive and negative fluxes generally vary between
different disciplines, however, and net carbon uptake is often denoted as a
negative flux in the literature.
<br><IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">BIOME-BGC uses daily maximum and minimum air temperatures, humidity,
incident solar radiation and precipitation to determine daily carbon and water
fluxes.  Average daily incident shortwave radiation (Qi) was simulated using
MT-CLIM logic described by Running et al. (1987).  Average daily net solar
radiation (Qn) was estimated using a prescribed, constant albedo for
vegetation.  Qn was attenuated through the vegetation canopy using Beer's
formulation and a prescribed extinction coefficient modulated by LAI to derive
the amount of solar radiation transmitted through the canopy (Qt).  The amount
of solar radiation absorbed by the canopy (Qa) was estimated as the difference
between Qi and Qt.  PPFD was estimated based on the assumption that
photosynthetically active radiation represents approximately 50% of Qa
(Running and Coughlan 1988).
<br><IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">Mean daily air temperature (Ta) was estimated as the average of the
measured daily maximum and minimum air temperatures.  Minimum daily air
temperature was assumed equal to the mean daily dew point and was used to
estimate the mean daily vapor pressure deficit (VPD).  Daily soil temperatures
at a 30 cm soil depth (Tsoil) were estimated using an 11 day running average
of Ta (Zheng et al. 1993).  Soil water potential (PSI) was estimated from soil
water content, soil depth and texture information following Cosby et al.
(1984).  Ta, VPD, PPFD and PSI were used to estimate gc and GPP following
Jarvis and Morison (1981) and Farquhar and von Caemmerer (1982), respectively.
<br><IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">Ta and Tsoil were used to estimate Rm while Tsoil and PSI were used to
estimate Rh (Running and Coughlan 1988).

BIOME-BGC will also be used within the context of a regional hydro-ecological
simulation system (RHESSys) to generate landscape level estimates of 1994
daily hydrologic and carbon fluxes within the 1x10^6 km^2 boreas study region.

The model requires a daily meteorological data file. This file consists
of 6 columns that are space delimited with each row of the file representing a
specific day of the year. Column 1 represents the day of year (Julian day
format, 1-365), coelum 2 represents precipitation (cm), column 3 represents
maximum 24 hr daily air temperature (C), column 4 represents minimum 24 hr
daily air temperature (C), column 5 represents total daily solar radiation
(direct+diffuse, kJ), column 6 represents the daylength (s).  A second file is
also required which defines site initialization parameters such as soil,
litter, leaf and sapwood carbon pools, soil type and condition. A detailed
discussion of the development of the tower site initialization parameter files
is presented below.
<br><IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">BIOME-BGC requires general information about stand morphology and soil
characteristics in order to simulate the water and carbon balance at a site.
Information required by the model to define initial hydrologic characteristics
of the study sites is given by Kimball et al. (submitted).  A list of critical
parameters used to define soil and stand carbon characteristics at the 8 study
sites are presented in Table 1.  These parameters were held constant
throughout the model runs.  Soil parameters were derived from measurements
collected at the sites during 1994 by Cuenca et al. (submitted) and values
reported in the literature for representative soil types (Hillel 1980).  The
soil depth was set at 0.5 m and assumed homogeneous in regard to soil
mineralized carbon, structure and soil moisture characteristics.  Mean daily
stand solar albedos for snow-free conditions were estimated from site
observations (Sellers et al. 1995).
<br><IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">Estimates of average annual leaf area index (LAI) were derived from
effective LAI measurements conducted over approximately 3 periods during the
1994 growing season at each study site by Chen (submitted).  Effective LAI was
measured using LI-COR LAI-2000 plant canopy analyzer and adjusted for foliage
clumping.  Specific leaf area  (SLA) and leaf nitrogen levels were determined
from plucked needle and leaf measurements at the spruce, jack pine and aspen
sites by Margolis et al. (1996 unpublished data).  The amounts of leaf
nitrogen in RuBisCO were estimated from the literature for representative
cover types (Field and Mooney 1986).  Leaf carbon was derived from LAI and SLA
information.  Sapwood carbon was estimated from sapwood biomass measurements
collected by Gower et al. (1996 unpublished data) at the black spruce, aspen
and jack pine sites, and estimates of the relative proportions of sapwood live
cells (Waring and Schlesinger 1985).  Coarse root carbon was estimated to be
approximately 25% of sapwood carbon (e.g. Grier et al. 1981, Grier and Logan
1977).
<br><IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">The amount of carbon attributed to fine root biomass is highly variable
depending on species type, stand age and nutrient availability.  Processes
governing the partitioning of carbon between root and foliar biomass are
generally poorly understood and not well quantified in the literature.
Observations have shown, however, that fine root biomass is generally greater
than foliar biomass in nutrient limited systems which often occur in boreal
and cold temperate forests and may represent an adaptation to maximize
nutrient uptake (Nadelhoffer et al. 1985, Keyes and Grier 1981, Tetrealt et
al. 1978).  Soil carbon attributed to fine roots was estimated from 1.5 (SOAS)
to 3.5 (SOJP) times the estimated leaf carbon based on observations from
boreal and cold temperate coniferous and deciduous stands on nutrient poor
sites (Gower et al. 1992, Comeau and Kimmins 1989, Nadelhoffer et al. 1985,
Linder and Axelson 1982, Perala and Alban 1982, Keyes and Grier 1981).  Soil
litter and mineralized organic carbon pools within the prescribed 0.5 m soil
depths were estimated from soil layer depth, bulk density and percent organic
carbon measurements conducted at each of the study sites by Anderson et al.
(1995 unpublished data).
<br><IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">Leaf, stem, coarse and fine root maintenance respiration coefficients
were estimated from measured rates for coniferous and deciduous cover types
(Sprugel et al. 1995).  All other ecophysiological parameters were obtained
from the literature for general cover types (e.g. Sprugel et al. 1995, Nobel
1991, Waring and Schlesinger 1985).

Air temperature, solar radiation and precipitation were measured at
approximate 15 minute intervals at each of the study sites during 1994.  These
data were obtained from BOREAS principle investigators at each study site and
the Saskatchewan Research Council's AMS mesonet database (BOREAS Science Team
1995).  The 1994, meteorological records for each study site were incomplete
due to periods of instrument malfunction, calibration and measurement
inactivity.  Continuous meteorological records for 1994 were obtained for each
study site by temporally interpolating missing data or substituting data from
adjacent sites.  Daily maximum and minimum air temperatures, precipitation and
solar radiation were then derived from the continuous data records for each
site and used to generate model results.
<br><IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">BIOME-BGC was run over a 2 year period at each study site.  The model was
initialized using 1989 AMS mesonet station meteorological data from the
Thompson airport (55.8 *N, 97.9 *W) for study sites in the NSA, and Prince
Albert airport (53.2 *N, 105.7 *W) and Waskesiu Lake (53.9 *N, 106.1 *W) for
study sites in the SSA (Shewchuk submitted).  All analyses of model results
were done for the second year using the 1994 meteorological database described

</center>
<p>
<B>10.1 Sources of Error</B><br>
BIOME-BGC is a process level model designed to be general enough to apply
at regional to global scales. The model uses several simplifying assumptions
regarding stand and meteorological conditions in order to facilitate
application at regional scales. A fundamental model assumption for this
investigation was that stand physiological conditions such as age, stand
structure, LAI and carbon storages were spatially and temporally uniform on an
annual basis. Soil conditions such as depth, density and moisture content were
also assumed spatially uniform with no lateral or subsurface drainage. Stand
conditions at the study sites were both spatially and temporally diverse and
were composed of different age types, biomass densities and species
compositions (BOREAS Science Team 1995). Some sites also had significant
vegetation understories that were not explicitly modeled in this
investigation. Evidence suggests that these vegetation types contributed
significantly to the daily carbon budget (e.g. Black et al. submitted).
Further discussion of potential error sources for this investigation is given
by Kimball et al. (1996 a,b submitted).
<p>
<B>10.2 Quality Assessment</B><br>
See section 10.1.
<p>
<B>10.2.1 Model Validation by Source</B><br>
Model results were compared with daily carbon and water fluxes derived
from site tower flux measurements for 1994. Model estimates of annual NPP were
also compared with NPP estimates derived from site biomass measurements and
allometric equations for 1994 (BOREAS Science Team 1995). Model estimates of
SNOWW and SOILW were compared with measured data for 1994 (BOREAS Science Team
1995). Detailed discussion of these comparisons are given by Kimball et al.
(1996 a,b submitted).

This model will be used in the context of RHESSys to generate landscape
level estimates of daily and annual water and carbon exchange processes over
the 1x10<sup>6</sup> km<sup>2</sup> boreas grid at a 1 km<sup>2</sup> spatial resolution.
<br><IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">Carbon allocation, growth respiration and nitrogen cycle routines will be
activated (See Running and Hunt 1993) and model runs will be conducted over
longer time periods (50 to several hundred years) to investigate the effects
of inter-annual climate variations on site to regional water and carbon
budgets.
