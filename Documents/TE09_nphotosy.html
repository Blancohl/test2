This data set describes the relationship between foliage nitrogen
concentration and photosynthetic capacity in the canopies of NSA-OBS,

<B>1.1 Data Set Identification</B><br>
Relationships between Photosynthetic Capacity and Nitrogen Concentration 
at the NSA.
<p>
<B>1.2 Data Set Introduction</B><br>
The canopy profiles of nitrogen concentration and photosynthetic capacity
were examined as part of our efforts to characterize the spatial and
temporal variations in photosynthetic capacity and nitrogen allocation in
the boreal forest. This information will be useful for modelling the
vertical distribution of carbon fixation for different forest types in 
the
boreal forest. Samples were taken from six forest types in the NSA: 
NSA-OBS,
NSA-UBS, NSA-OJP, NSA-YJP AND NSA-OASP during each of the three intensive 
field campaigns in 1994.<br>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">Measurements were taken under controlled environmental conditions in the
laboratory. We used an open gas exchange system in differential mode for 
measuring the photosynthetic capapcity.
<p>
<B>1.3 Objective/Purpose</B><br>
This data set was collected and prepared to provide the profile of 
photosynthetic capacity and nitrogen concentration in the forest canopy 
of NSA-OBS (Picea mariana (Mill.),  NSA-UBS (Picea mariana (Mill.), 
NSA-OJP (Pinus banksiana Lamb.), NSA-YJP AND NSA-OASP (Populus 
tremuloides Michx.) in the Northern Study Area.  This information will 
also be useful for modelling the vertical distribution of carbon fixation 
for different forest types in the boreal forest.

</center>
During the process of photosynthesis, CO<sub>2</sub> is assimilated by the green 
leaves
while H<sub>2</sub>O is released into the atmosphere. The amount of water released 
and
the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> absorbed are determined by comparing the concentrations 
of
water vapor and CO<sub>2</sub> in the air moving into the leaf cuvette and those in 
the
air moving out of the cuvette at a certain flow rate. The concentration 
of
CO<sub>2</sub> and water vapor in both in-coming and out-going air streams are 
measured
using an infra-red gas analyzer.<br>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">The total nitrogen concentration of foliage was determined by the 
Kjeldahl
method. This consists of two main steps: (1) The nitrogen in the sample 
is
converted to NH<sub>4</sub>+ N by digestion with concentrated H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> containing
substances that promote this conversion. (2) The NH<sub>4</sub>+ N is determined 
from
the amount of NH<sub>3</sub> liberated by distillation of the digest with alkali. 
This
is a common procedure for total nitrogen determination for plant 
materials.

<B>4.1.1 Collection Environment</B><br>
The vertical profile of the canopy was divided into three layers; top,
middle and bottom. For old black spruce, upland high-productivity (TE) 
black
spruce and old jack pine, all three layers were of the same species. In 
the
young jack pine, the bottom layer was the understory black spruce 
seedlings,
while the top and middle layers were jack pine. In the old aspen, the 
bottom
layer was alder while the top and middle layers were aspen. Branch 
samples
were harvested from each layer and were immediately re-cut under water. 
The
samples were then transported back to the laboratory for gas exchange
measurements. The cut-surface of the branch was submerged in water during transport and in the laboratory.<br>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">Samples were cut in the dark. The samples that were about to be measured, however, were exposed to saturated light for two hours before the 
beginning
of the measurements to induce stomatal opening and photosynthetic 
activity.
To keep a continual supply of water to the branch, the cut surface was in contact with water during the entire period. The light source was two 1000-watt high pressure sodium lamps. Different levels of light was 
achieved
by using different neutral density filters. The environmental conditions
inside the leaf cuvette were as follows: temperature 20 +/- 0.5 C; vapor
pressure deficit 0.7 +/- 0.2 kPa; CO<sub>2</sub> 360  +/- 20 ppm.<br>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">Photosynthesis and related parameters are all expressed on a hemi-surface area basis. The shape factors the leaf area calculation were 4 and 4.59,
respectively, for black spruce and jack pine.
<p>
<B>4.1.2 Source/Platform</B><br>
Branch samples were taken using a shotgun and were re-cut under water.
Photosynthesis was measured in the laboratory under controlled 
environment. 
<p>
<B>4.1.3 Source/Platform Mission Objectives</B><br>
<UL>
<LI>To obtain the canopy profile of photosynthetic capacity and nitrogen concentration.
<LI>To examine inter-specific and inter-seasonal differences in these canopy profiles. 
</UL>
<p><br>
<B>4.1.4 Key Variables</B><br>
Rate of light-saturated net photosynthesis, foliar nitrogen concentration
<p>
<B>4.1.5 Principles of Operation</B><br>
Eight samples were measured from each canopy level.  Two samples were 
measured at a time and the measurement proceeded alternating between 
different canopy levels.
<p>
<B>4.1.6 Sensor/Instrument Measurement Geometry</B><br>
Samples were all taken from the upper third of the forest canopy.  
Efforts were made to keep the amount of foliage relatively consistent 
from sample to sample.  The leaf chamber for the measurement is about 
1300 cubic inch.

<B>4.2 Calibration</B><br>
The gas analyzer was calibrated against standard gas which was calibrated
against the prime CO<sub>2</sub> standard in the NSA lab in Thompson. Calibration 
was
done at the beginning of each field campaign. 
<P>
<B>4.2.1 Specifications</B><br>
The weighing balance was accurate to within 0.0001 g.
The leaf area system was accurate to within 1%.
The gas exchange system was accurate to 1 ppm CO<sub>2</sub>.<br>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">The shape factor used for black spruce was 4, as according to the BOREAS 
Experiment Plan, appendix K, Version 3.0). Based on observations of two 
cross sections of two needles per fascicle for five fascicles for six 
jack pine trees from Thompson, Manitoba, we calculated an average shape 
factor of 4.59 (+/- 0.07).
<p>
<B>4.2.1.1 Tolerance</B><br>
No tolerance level was set for these measurements.
<p>
<B>4.2.2 Frequency of Calibration</B><br>
LI-COR 6262 IRGA was calibrated at the beginning of each IFC.
