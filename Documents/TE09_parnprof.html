<B>1.1 Data Set Identification</B><br>
Light/N profile data.
<p>
<B>1.2 Data Set Introduction</B><br>
<p>
<B>1.3 Objective/Purpose</B><br>
The purpose of this project was to quantify the relationship between percent
PAR levels and leaf nitrogen of three boreal forest tree species, black
spruce, jack pine and aspen at the BOREAS Northern Study Area.
<p>
<B>1.4 Summary of Parameters</B><br>
Downwelling photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), FPAR, leaf nitrogen
(N) concentration, specific leaf nitrogen (N) (i.e. N per unit leaf area)
<p>
<B>1.5 Discussion</B><br>
Functional convergence predicts that the investment into leaf nitrogen is
limited by the amount of available light (PAR) which in turn determines
photosynthetic capacity. This study tests this hypothesis through
measurements of the relationship between FPAR, PAR and N.<br>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">The downwelling radiation data from the northern study area (NSA) of the
BOREAS study area were collected to characterize the fpar levels at
different canopy levels of six boreal canopy cover types: young jack pine,
old jack pine, young aspen, old aspen, old (lowland) black spruce and upland
TE black spruce. Leaf samples were harvested at each light level, in order
to quantify specific leaf nitrogen content by leaf/needle age class.
Radiation data were collected between May 27, 1994 and September 17, 1994.

<B>4.1.1 Collection Environment</B><br>
<p>
<B>4.1.2 Source/Platform</B><br>
A quantum sensor was supported at the top of a pole that was extended to
different levels in the canopy, following a vertical profile from the top of
the canopy to the groundcover and understory shrubs. These levels were
variable depending on the type of understory vegetation and the canopy
profile. One point quantum sensor was used to obtain simultaneous 100% light
readings. This sensor was placed on a pole extended from a canopy access
tower or a pole that was extended sufficiently above the tree canopy level
to avoidany shading during the sampling period. The data acquisition system
was kept at the sampling level while using canopy access towers, or on the
ground.
<p>
<B>4.1.3 Source/Platform Mission Objectives</B><br>
(As outlined in the Experiment Plan, Version 3, Appendix N, page N-34)
To examine the relationship betweeen net photsynthetic (net Ps) capacity, N
concentration and percent photsynthetically active radiation of three major
boreal forest cover types (jack pine, black spruce and aspen) as well as
their link to remotely-sensed and land-based measures of reflected and
absorbed radiation.<br>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">To establish general relationships which can be used to predict the vertical
distribution of the net Ps capacity for these cover types, including their
understories, when neither water nor temperature is greatly limiting.
<p>
<B>4.1.4 Key Variables</B><br>
PAR, FPAR, and N.
<p>
<B>4.1.5 Principles of Operation</B><br>
A quantum sensor under full sky exposure was set out under cloudy (diffuse)
sky conditions in each stand type. A second quantum sensor was moved
vertically throughout the canopy profile starting at ground level.
Vegetation at each light harvesting level was removed in order to determine
specific N content.<br>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">LI-COR quantum sensors measure photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in
the 400 to 700 nm wave band. The unit of measurements ismicromoles per
second per square meter (umol/s/m2). The quantum sensor is designed to
measure PAR received on a plane surface. The indicated sensor response
corresponds to the expected photosynthetic response of plants for which data
is available. A silicon photodiode with an enhanced response in the visible
wavelengths is used as the sensor. A visible bandpass interference filter in
combination with coloured glass filters is mounted in a cosine corrected head.<br>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">Quantum sensors were connected to a data acquisition system. This system
(CR10) was programmed to convert a differential voltage measurement (rather
than a single ended measurement because of noise reduction) to a radiation
value. Each quantum sensor has a different calibration constant provided by
the manufacturing company that must be incorporated into the programming of
the CR10.<br>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">The CR10 is a fully programmable datalogger/controller that permits a user
to convert electronic responses of a sensor to comprehensible information
about our physical environment (e.g. temperature, radiation). It allows the
user to store data and program the retrieved data.<br>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">The AgVision System is an image analysis system that works by first looking
at an object through a video camera, then processing theimage into discrete
numerical information with a digitizer and microcomputer, and finally
displaying the image or other informationon a monitor for examination.<br>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">The Kjeldahl method, the most common method for nutrient analysis, will be
used for measuring total N.

<B>4.2 Calibration</B><br>
Quantum sensors that were used in the field were brand new. Calibration was
completed by the manufacturing company, and recalibration of radiation
sensors is normally recommended every two years. The calibration data is
unique to each sensor and so this was incorporated into the programming when
connected to a data acquisition system.<br>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">Prior to the season's field sampling, all quantum sensors were compared to
confirm that no differences in measurements existed. This involved comparing
radiation readings from the same light source. Following a comparison of
electrical environmental conditions (outside a building versus inside the
photosynthetic lab), a differential mode configuration rather than a single
ended voltage configuration was found to reduce response fluctuations (due
to electrical noise primarily). Therefore, the differential mode programming
and wiring set up were used. In the field, a quick comparison among quantum
sensors under similar light conditions was made.<br>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">The optical image analysis system was calibrated according to instrument
specifications each time the system was opened or after it was left for a
period of time. A fine ruler and flat disks of known area were used in the
calibration.<br>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">Calibration of Kjeldahl instrumentation is unknown at this time. 
<P>
<B>4.2.1 Specifications</B><br>
The quantum sensors had a resolution capability of 1 umol m-2 s-1. The
absolute calibration is +/- 5% traceable to the US National Institute of
Standards and Technology.<br>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">The weighing balance was accurate to within 0.0001 g.<br>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">The leaf area system was accurate to within 1%.<br>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">The shape factor used for black spruce leaf area measurements was 4,
according to the BOREAS Experiment Plan, appendix K, Version 3). Based on
observations of two cross sections of two needles per fascicle for five
fascicles for six jack pine trees from Thompson, Manitoba, we calculated an
average shape factor of 4.59 (+/- 0.07).<br>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">Specifications of Kjeldahl instrumentation is unknown at this time. 
<P>
<B>4.2.1.1 Tolerance</B><br>
The acceptable range for our radiation measurements is between 0 and 2000
umol m-2 s-1. The quantums are typically sensitive to 8 uA per 1000 umol m-2
s-1. There is a maximum deviation of 1% up to 10,000 umol/s/m2.
<p>
<B>4.2.2 Frequency of Calibration</B><br>
Field checks of quantum sensor readings were carried out upon installation
of the quantums and everytime data was transferred.<br>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">Quantum sensor calibration was completed by the manufacturing company, and
recalibration of radiation sensors is normally recommended every two years.
<p>
<B>4.2.3 Other Calibration Information</B><br>
Information regarding calibration for N analysis using the Kjeldahl method
is unavailable at this time.

</center>
<P>
Downwelling radiation data for the northern study area (NSA) of the BOREAS
study area were collected to characterize the vertical profile of fpar (the
fraction of above canopy PAR) of six boreal forest canopy cover types: young
jack pine, old jack pine, young aspen, old aspen, old (lowland) and upland
black spruce. These data were collected during diffuse light conditions
(overcast/cloudy days) during the three field campaigns between May 27, 1994 and September 17, 1994.
<P>
For each stand, the following activities took place:
<UL>
<LI>Vertical light profiles were established in each forest cover type based on 5 randomly chosen branches at 5 height levels (top, middle, and lower third of the crown, top of understory shrubs and top of ground cover ). Where there were two levels of understory shrubs, another level was taken into account. Sampling took place from the bottom up. That is, samples were harvested starting from the ground cover level before moving up vertically in order to avoid any effect on subsequent light measurements.
<p>
<LI>Light readings on cloudy (diffuse light conditions) days were obtained for each stand using a quantum sensor connected to a data acquisition system (CR10, Campbell Scientific). A BNC connector and a millivolt adaptor (604 ohms) were connected to each sensor that was connected to the CR10 data measurement system. Quantum sensors were suspended for a minimum period of 2 minutes at each level just above a branch level that was subsequently harvested (Input readings= 5 seconds, Output readings = 1 minute). One quantum sensor was extended to obtain simultaneous readings of 100% PAR. This sensor was placed on a pole extended from a canopy access tower ora pole that was extended sufficiently above the tree canopy level to avoid any shading during the measurement period. This made itpossible to calculate the fraction of above canopy PAR (FPAR) that was attenuated, where 100% FPAR is complete interception, or darkness, and 0 % is completely exposed and equal to 100 % PAR.
<p>
<LI>For the radiation measurements in the canopy, one person leaned over the canopy access tower holding a pole with the quantum attached at the end, while another person manipulated the CR10 at the same level. Following each measurement level, the light readings were transferred directly to a storage module. 
<p>
<LI>The fraction of absorbed PAR (FPAR) was calculated for each measurement point. 
<p>
<LI>The radiation measurements were based on a total of two point-quantum sensors (one taking the canopy profile and one at full light) which were relayed to a data acquisition system (CR-10). All quantum sensors were connected to the same CR10 for simultaneous measurements. Consequently, it was possible to calculate the fraction of above canopy PAR (FPAR) that was attenuated, where 100% FPAR iscomplete interception, or darkness, and 0% is completely exposed and equal to 100% PAR. Sensor readings were taken every 10 seconds, while output measurements were based on 5 minute intervals. 
<p>
<LI>A branch at each light level was cut using a set of extendible pruning shears. These samples were used for N measurements. On conifer trees, these samples included the most recent year's needle growth and at least 2 years of previous needle growth. Branches forN analysis were stored in identified polyethylene bags for transport. These samples were stored in a freezer until time for further manipulation was available. A subsample of these branches was cut in order to determine specific leaf area. The remaining branches were oven-dried for 48 hours at 68'C, after which the lignified material was separated from the foliage tissue. The foliage tissue was then ground at one mm and stored in sealed plastic containers until %N was quantified.
<p>
<LI>The material will be oven dried again and weighed 2 hours prior to N analysis. At least 200 mg of dried materiel was necessary for each N analysis. The Kjeldahl method was used to estimate nitrogen concentration. Nitrogen will be expressed both on a specific leaf surface area and a weight basis.
<p>
<LI>Specfic leaf area was measured for each conifer leaf sample, by age class, using the volume displacement method to measure half the area of the surface of the leaf (HASL). An optical image analysis system (Decagon) was also used to measure shoot silouette area and projected leaf area. For flat surfaces, such as aspen leaves, the hemi-surface area is the same as the projected area and is the same as the silhouette area. The silhouette area of conifer samples were measured by age class. (In the first IFC, however, there was only one age-class). A conifer shoot was first snipped/clipped into 2 age classes. These two age classes included (1) 1994 needles and (2) anything produced in 1993 and younger..Each shoot section was then randomly thrown under the camera lense and a silhouette measurement was taken. These samples were then processed under the normal procedures for measuring leaf area (volume displacement). 
<p>
<LI>In order to conduct the volume diplacement method for measuring conifer leaf area, a container that is large enough for an intact shoot to be submerged is filled with water and about 3-5% detergent mixed in with the water. The detergent is necessary because it prevents small air bubbles and films from accumulating on the surface of the shoot. The container has to be large enough for the shoot to be submerged without touching the walls of the container. The container and liquid are placed on a top loading electronic
balance and tared to provide a zero reading. An intact shoot is submerged in
the liquid without touching the walls of the container and the weight
recorded. To push the shoot into the water, a force equal to the buoyant
force must be applied. The buoyant force is related to the mass of the
volume of water displace by the shoot. Thus, the volume of the intact shoot
in cubic centimeters is numerically equal to the weight increase in grams
indicated on the balance. The length of these needles is determined. If
measuring all the needles is too time consuming, the number of needles on
the shoot are counted and a subsample of 10 to 20 needles spaced over the
length of the shoot may be used. The needles are then removed from the shoot
and the volume of the woody portion of the shoot is measured by submerging
it in the liquid-filled container on the balance. The needle volume is the
difference between the total volume and the woody volume. 
<p>
<LI>The shape of the cross-sectional area is determined from observations under
a microscope. This shape is usually fixed for all needles of a given species
and so has to be determined only once for a given species. This shape
determines the coefficients in an equation that relates the previous
measurements to the surface area. The shape factor for black spruce is 4.00
(BOREAS Experiment Plan, Version 3.0 Appendix K). Based on observations of
two cross-sections of two needles per fascicle for five fascicles for six
jack pine trees from Thompson, Manitoba we calculated an average shape
factor of 1993 needles as 4.59 (_ 0.07).(1)
<p>

<B>9.1 Formulae</B><br>
FPAR (%)=((PAR at 100% exposure - PAR reading below canopy)/PAR at 100%
exposure)*100.  For example, if the maximum PAR (no shading)was 890 and the
PAR value underneath canopy was 230, then FPAR under the canopy = 74.16% =
((890-230)/890) x 100

<p>
<B>9.2.1 Processing Steps</B><br>
Data from quantum sensors was first converted from electrical (voltage) data
to a radiation value in a program (given by the user) for the CR10. This
program is specific to this data acquisition system. See the manual for
programming if you want to learn how to program (Campbell Scientific).<br>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">Each minute the CR10 was programmed to take the data which was being
retrieved every second, and do the following:
<UL>
<LI>identify the site location-output the Julian Day, hour and minute-output
the minimum battery voltage. This was done to check for data errors because
of a low battery source. (If the battery charge is below 9.6, we can expect
errors in the data set).-output the maximum internal temperature of the
module panel. This was done to be able to check for data errors if the
temperature of the CR10 system was too high. We can expect errors in the
data set when the temperature is greater than 50 C.-output the average,
standard deviation, maximum and minimum radiation values for each of the 2
quantum sensors.
</UL>
Data was then transferred from the field site to a storage module which was
brought back to a computer for data transfer and verification.<br>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">All raw data was printed. Column headings were inserted. Subsequently, all
lines that were not part of the sampling scheme were erased. A code that had
been entered into the CR10 program in place of the site location enabled us
to identify when the relevant light data was not being taken. This code was
normally 1.2 and has no other meaning other than to signify that the light
values at this time are not useful. For example, the sensor may at this time
have been between two different light levels.<br>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">Lines that contained zero readings for the quantum sensors were erased
(using the autofilter function in Excel, version 5.0).  Where only 1 minute
or less of data existed per level, these lines were not removed (to avoid
blank data cells) Data was then sorted in order of the light profile. Light
readings by minute for a level were then averaged together (using the
subtotals function in Excel,version 5.0), so that at each change in SITEID
the function AVERAGE was used to subtotal all the columns of data.<br>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">%PAR and FPAR values were calculated.  Year and cdate (calendar date) were
inserted as columns.<br>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">Manitoba time data was converted from a numeric format to a time format
(because original data was in numeric format). The following command was
used in Excel, version 5 to do this step:
time(mid(a1;1;len(a1)-2);right(a1;2);0). Where a1 refers to the data cell
where the time data was found. This value may be f1, for example, depending
on what column the data was found. Manitoba time was then converted to
Greenwich Mean Time = Thompson, Manitoba time + 6 hours.<br>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">Shoot silhouette data, specific leaf area and leaf area data were then
transferred into the data files. (At this point there is only one line of
data for each desired light level). Data was then checked with original data
sheets.<br>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">Note that the SLA samples corresponding to the YJP stand in IFC 1 (May 29, 1994) were either misplaced, ground or lost.  In order tocompensate for this
lost SLA data, the SLA data from the photosynthesis data (May 27, group
TE-9B), were substituted. The SLA represent the same sampling levels, but
only 4 repetitions were available for this set. Photosynthesis was measured
on 3 branches at each canopy level for 5 yjp trees. An average sla (based on
3 branches for each canopy level) was used.

<p>
<B>10.1 Sources of Error</B><br>
If the wiring to the CR10 is not fixed securely, loose wires can lead to
dubious data results. Likewise if wires have been chewed up by rodents or by
hungry canopy tower people, results may be questionable. We had no evidence
of these activities during the field season.<br>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">If the battery charge is below 9.6 volts, we can expect errors in the data
set. We checked for this in our data set, but it is doubtful that this
happened since at every data transfer in the field this value was checked.<br>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">We can expect errors in the data set when the CR10 module temperature is
greater than 50 C. We checked for this in our data set. However, despite the
warm and dry conditions that were experienced this summer, it was unlikely
that this everoccurred. The storage module was placed in a shady understory
location.
