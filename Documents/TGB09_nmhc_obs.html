<p>
<B>1.1 Data Set Identification</B><br>
BOREAS TGB9-IFC1:  above canopy NMHCs at SSA-OBS site.
<p>
<B>1.2 Data Set Introduction</B><br>
BOREAS TGB09 non-methane hydrocarbon (NMHC) data from the SSA-OBS site.
<p>
<B>1.3 Objective/Purpose</B><br>
To provide a quantitative inventory of non-methane hydrocarbons, both anthropogenic and biogenic, at the SSA-OBS site. To provide ambient concentration data for biogenic hydrocarbons suitable for calculating the flux of biogenic hydrocarbons at the SSA-OBS site using the gradient method.
<p>
<B>1.4 Summary of Parameters</B><br>
Concentrations in the parts per trillion by volume (pptv) - parts per billion by volume (ppbv) range are reported for a variety of biogenic and anthropogenic non methane hydrocarbons. Local sources and transport from distant sources contribute to the non-methane hydrocarbon inventory in the boreal forest region. A quantitative inventory of ambient hydrocarbon concentrations can aid in identification of sources important to the boreal atmosphere. In particular, gradient measurements allow biogenic emissions from the forest itself to be quantified.
<p>
<B>1.5 Discussion</B><br>
Whole air samples were simultaneously collected from two heights on the flux tower for several 30 minute periods during IFC1. These sampling periods were distributed between 8:00 am and 8:00 PM on five days in late May - early June using gas chromatographic (GC) techniques. Permissible injection volumes for capillary GC are below 1 cc (gas). Typical concentrations for the hydrocarbon species that we measure are in the range of 10 pptv to 10 ppbv, which, for isoprene as example, gives an analyte range of 0.06 to 60 fg/cc. The constraint on injection volume for capillary GC combined with the low concentrations of analyte require that the samples be preconcentrated prior to GC analysis. Sample preconcentration is accomplished by passing a known volume of the air sample through a trap filled with fine glass beads that is cooled to -180C. With this technique, the volatile hydrocarbons of interest are quantitatively retained in the trap, whereas the bulk constituents of air (nitrogen, oxygen, etc.) are not. The nitrogen and oxygen are collected in a vessel of known volume, the reference volume. From the pressure in the reference volume, the total volume of air which passed through the preconcentration system is known. This volume is used to calculate the mixing ratio of each compound in the original air sample after Gas Chromatographic (Flame Ionization Detector, GC-FID) analysis. The sample trapped cryogenically on the glass beads is thermally desorbed into a stream of ultra-pure helium and re-trapped on the surface of a fine stainless steel capillary cooled to -180C. This second cryogenic trapping stage "focuses" the sample into a small linear section of tubing. The cold stainless steel capillary is ballistically heated (by electrical resistance) and the focused sample quickly desorbs into the helium stream and is transferred to the chromatographic column.<br>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">The volatile components of the sample are carried through the GC column by the mobile phase, the ultra-pure helium. Capillary GC columns are typically a long (10 - 100m) section of fused silica capillary (0.18-0.53mm inner diameter, I.D.). The inside surface of the column has a thin (0.05-5m) coating of a stationary phase designed to interact with the components of a mixture passing through the column. For any individual hydrocarbon, the amount of time taken to traverse the length of the column (retention time) is determined by the component's affinity for the stationary phase, which, in turn, is a function of the chemical nature of the component. This differential affinity of various species for the stationary phase makes it possible for the GC column to separate a complex mixture as it travels through the column. Controlled variation of column temperature over the course of the analysis (temperature program) also affects the separation of the compounds, the retention time for each compound, and the total analysis time for the sample. Compounds are identified by their characteristic retention times.<br>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">Compounds eluting from the end of the column are detected using a flame ionization detector (FID), in which the column effluent is introduced into a hydrogen-air diffusion flame. Electrically charged species formed through radical reactions in the flame are collected by applying a potential across the flame and the current is amplified by a sensitive electrometer. The FID displays a linear response to carbon atoms over a large dynamic range. The FID is very sensitive to hydrocarbons, but is insensitive to water or carbon dioxide.<br>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">In addition to the FID detector, some of our samples are analyzed using a mass selective detector (MSD). The MSD produces mass spectra of the species eluted from the column. The MSD is less sensitive than the FID, but provides a more certain identification of the species eluted by relying not only on the retention time, but also on the mass spectrum of the effluent. As compounds exit the column, they are hit by the high energy stream of electrons and a fraction of the molecules are converted to ions. Some molecules are fragmented by the electron impact, and produce ions with a mass less than the original molecule. The ions are electrically accelerated into a quadrupole mass filter, which allows only ions within a narrow range of mass-charge ratio to pass to an electron multiplier. The electron multiplier counts the number of ions which strike it. By scanning a range of mass-charge ratios, the MSD can construct a mass spectrum for each compound exiting the column. The pattern and abundance of ions produced is characteristic of the chemical structure of a compound, and thus may be used to identify species eluting from the column. In general, we use the MSD results to qualitatively identify unknown compounds present in the samples, while the FID results provide quantitative data. Unlike the FID, the MSD is sensitive to water and carbon dioxide.<br>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">Water and carbon dioxide are present in ambient air in amounts several orders of magnitude larger than any of the non-methane hydrocarbons. Both water and carbon dioxide are quantitatively trapped in the preconcentration step and although small amounts will not affect FID operation, typical ambient concentrations do pose chromatographic problems, and problems with the MSD operation. Water and carbon dioxide have a detrimental effect on the chromatographic separation of hydrocarbons. Their presence in the preconcentrated sample greatly increases its volume and prevents the hydrocarbons from being tightly focused on the head of the column. Because of its polar nature, water interferes with the interaction between the hydrocarbons and the stationary phase of the column. Water can also clog the glass bead trap, cryo-focuser, or column during the analysis, and may extinguish the FID flame. In the MSD, high water and carbon dioxide signals increase the background signals for other ions such that the detection limit is raised to an unsuitable level. In order to avoid these problems, water and carbon dioxide are removed from the air samples prior to preconcentration. A cold trap (-20 to -60 _C) removes water in sufficient amounts to allow chromatographic analysis to proceed without any clogging or FID quenching. A potassium carbonate trap at 80 _C removes carbon dioxide. We have tested these traps extensively to assure that the concentrations of the hydrocarbons of interest are not affected.<br>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">Each sample was analyzed on two separate GC-FID systems. In one, the column and temperature program were chosen to optimize quantitation of C2 - C6 hydrocarbons. In the other, the column and temperature program were chosen to optimize quantitation of C5 - C10 hydrocarbons.

<P>
Estimates of the hydrocarbon flux above the canopy by the gradient method require measurement of the hydrocarbon concentration gradient. To accomplish this, simultaneous samples were collected at two heights above the canopy and analyzed for a range of hydrocarbons. The flux of any particular hydrocarbon (HC) can then be determined by the following relationship :
<P>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">FLUX(HC) = k(z) * ([HC]" - [HC]') / (z" - z')
<P>
where ([HC]" - [HC]') is the difference in [HC] between the two heights z" and z'. The eddy diffusivity coefficient k(z) should be obtained from other researchers performing simultaneous measurements at the same sites. Measurements of the hydrocarbon concentrations are made by collecting whole air samples over a 30 minute period in evacuated, electropolished stainless steel canisters which are then transported to our laboratory for analysis. Before being shipped to Saskatchewan for sample collection, the canisters were heated to 80C and evacuated to 10 e-6 Torr for two hours.

Air was pumped from the sampling site on the tower through a Teflon line into a sample canister. The mass flow controller held the pumping rate constant as the can filled to a final pressure of about 20 psi (pounds per square inch). Two pumping systems (mounted on the same backpack) with inlets at different points on the tower were used in order to fill two cans simultaneously with air from different heights above the canopy.

<P>
Calibration of the GC systems is accomplished using prepared gas mixtures in air of known concentration to determine the characteristic retention time and FID response for each compound in the mixture. Measured FID responses are checked against the expected response based on the number of carbon atoms in each compound, since the FID response is linear over a large range, and is essentially mass responsive to carbon atoms.

The two outlets of the pumping system were connected to evacuated stainless steel canisters. The inlets of the pumping system were connected to Teflon lines mounted on a tower so that air could be sampled simultaneously from two heights above the forest canopy. The flow rate for the mass flow controllers was set such that each can would fill to a pressure of about 20 psig during 30 minutes of sampling. The cans were sealed by shutting the valve, then the full cans were shipped to our laboratory for analysis.<br>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">Approximately 500 - 700 mL (at standard temperature and pressure) of sample was used for GC-FID analysis. The sample handling procedure is described in more detail in Section 4.

<p>
<B>10.1 Sources of Error</B><br>
The user is advised to check meteorological data carefully before using this data to calculate fluxes by the gradient method, and to know the limitations of this method. Because compound identification is based on residence time, it is possible to misidentify a compound which is present in a real sample but not present in our calibration standard. We have adjusted our temperature programs to achieve good separation for the compounds in our calibration standards, but additional species present in real samples may co-elute. This is unlikely to cause problems for our C2 - C6 data, because the calibration standard for light hydrocarbons is comprehensive, but there may be interferences in the C5 - C10 data.

Samples were collected in evacuated stainless steel canisters and shipped to our laboratory in Toronto, ON for analysis by GC-FID. Concentrations in the pptv - ppbv range are reported for a variety of biogenic and anthropogenic non methane hydrocarbons. Our measurements are sufficiently precise for use in calculating fluxes by the gradient method. They are also valuable as a record of the ambient trace gas concentrations present in the region.
<p>
<B>10.2.2 Confidence Level/Accuracy Judgment</B><br>
We are quite confident in our C2 - C6 data. The C10 concentrations may require adjustment later, but are reasonable.
<p>
<B>10.2.3 Measurement Error for Parameters</B><br>
Absolute concentrations are considered accurate within 10%, limited by the uncertainty in the concentrations in our calibration standards. Uncertainty in gradients calculated from these concentrations is determined by the precision of our analysis, which is quoted in section 5.2.1.1.
<p>
<B>10.2.4 Additional Quality Assessments</B><br>
As data from other investigators becomes available, we will compare our results with theirs and update our data and documentation as necessary.

<B>11.1 Limitations of the Data</B><br>
<p>
<B>11.2 Known Problems with the Data</B><br>
Three samples in this data set contain unusually high levels of anthropogenic hydrocarbons. They are:
<br><IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif"> 12.4m 02-Jun-94 13:25
<br><IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif"> 12.4m 02-Jun-94 14:35
<br><IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif"> 23.3m 04-Jun-94 12:00.<br>
This is not a problem with our GC analysis; values from the two GC-FID systems for C6 hydrocarbons agree well. The high concentrations of light hydrocarbons such as ethane and propane indicate that contamination of the canisters is not a factor; these species are removed very effectively by our cleaning procedure. In fact, 23.3m 04-Jun-94 12:00 was collected in a new canister purchased for this project. We suggest referring to other measurements of trace gas concentrations at these times to determine whether a significant, transient, local anthropogenic source existed.
<P>
Canisters with samples:

<br><IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">12.4 04-Jun-94 16:00<br>
arrived at our laboratory empty, the valves having leaked.
<P>
C10 data for some samples is missing. Their chromatograms are being reintegrated to improve accuracy. These concentrations will be provided in a future revision.
