<B>Objectives:</B> To create a coordinated program of data collection for soil properties and soil monitoring over the BOREAS sites in collaboration with ecosystem, hydrologic and staff scientists. Properties collected include bulk density, particle size distribution, soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions. The resulting data set is being used for initialization, parameterization, and verification of simulation models in the fields of remote sensing, atmospheric modeling, ecological systems modeling, hydrology and simulation of soil physical processes. In order to meet the needs of the various research teams, the measurement program is divided into the areas of:
<UL>
<LI>Core Measurement Program
<LI>IFC Soil Moisture Content, Water Table and Soil Property Monitoring
<LI>Continuous Soil Moisture Content and Temperature Monitoring
<LI>Surface Moisture Measurement
<LI>Soil Survey and Characterization
<li>Soils Data for Auxiliary Sites
</UL>
The second objective of this project is the simulation of soil physical processes. A finite element model for simulation of soil physical processes are beign parameterized using the data described above, and tested and verified using soil monitoring data collected at the BOREAS tower sites. The calibrated simulation models for infiltration, soil moisture redistribution, evapotranspiration, and drainage will then be available for prediction of the soil moisture state at locations of interest to researchers working at sites where only Core Measurement Program data are collected, as well as regionally over the BOREAS experimental domain for the predominant soil types.

<H2 align=center>HYD-1 BOREAS Operations in 1994</H2>
<p>
<br>
<B>Objectives:</B><br>
To design a coordinated program of data collection for soil properties and soil monitoring over the BOREAS tower flux sites. Quantify soil water and hydraulic properties at flux tower sites, including the development of a soil water retention function for each site. 
<p>
<B>Data Collected:</B><br>
Soil water content data was collected using neutron probe and time domain reflectometry equipment at depths down to 1.7 meters. Soil hydraulic properties were assessed using tension infiltrometer equipment. Soil tension data was collected using tension blocks buried at depths down to 1.4 meters located near the neutron probe access tubes. Below-canopy precipitation measurements were made using manual precipitation gauges.<br>
<IMG SRC="../../gifs/indent.gif">Soil water monitoring was conducted on an every other day basis at the NSA and SSA Old Jack Pine, Young Jack Pine and Old Black Spruce (OBS IFC's 2-3) sites during the 1994 summer IFC's. Soil water was monitored approximately every other day at the SSA Young Aspen site during IFC's 2 and 3. Soil water measurements were conducted at the SSA Old Aspen by TE-1 during the 1994 summer IFC's. Six to ten unsaturated hydraulic conductivity tests were conducted at all sites except SSA and NSA FEN sites. Soil tension measurements were conducted in conjunction with the soil water measurements at all the Jack Pine sites and at the Young Aspen site in the South. Below-canopy precipitation measurements were made at each neutron probe access tube at all the Jack Pine sites during the 1994 summer IFC's. Precipitation measurement was conducted on an every other day basis. 
<p>
<B>Known Problems and Caveats:</B><br>
The only data collection problem encountered involved the inability to obtain an adequate soil to sensor interface using the tension block equipment. The tension measurements are therefore being evaluated and will not be submitted to BORIS unless they meet the acceptance criteria.
