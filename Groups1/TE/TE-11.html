<H2 align=center>TE-11: Seasonal Variations of Net Photosynthesis and Transpiration at the Tree Level</H2>

<B>Collaborator(s):</B> Andre Granier, Eric Dufrene, Jean-Yves Pontailler, Anne Ruimy
<P>
<B>Objectives:</B> To monitor the net assimilation and transpiration rate of trees throughout the 1994 growing season, at the <A HREF="../../Sites1/SSA-OJP.html">Prince Albert Old Jack Pine</A> site (and short sapflow measurements in <A HREF="../../Sites1/SSA-Mix.html">P.A. mixed-stand</A>). For this we propose the following steps using several original methods:
<OL>
<LI>Installation of sapflow probes in the trunk of 6 representative trees in <A HREF="../../Sites1/SSA-OJP.html">SSA-OJP</A> at the end of FFC-T, monitoring of sapflow from May to September 1994 (<A HREF="../../Sites1/SSA-Mix.html">Prince Albert Mixed Site</A> will be equipped with sapflow probes during the IFC-2 campaign only).. The probes are laboratory made, constant heated needles. 
<LI>Measurements during IFC-2 of CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O exchanges of 2 representative branches (<A HREF="../../Sites1/SSA-OJP.html">SSA-OJP</A>). Estimation of the water use efficiency (WUE: CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation/transpiration). The gas-exchange is measured in home-made cuvettes operating in a closed system for 5 minutes every half-hour.
<LI>Modelling of photosynthesis, transpiration and WUE of the branch. WUE varies with VPD and may vary through the season (needle age). This will be checked by measuring the delta 13C of growing shoot samples collected monthly (collaboration with <A HREF="../TF/TF-05.html">TF-5</A>).
<li>Use of 1., 2. and 3. to predict trees transpiration and carbon uptake during whole season.
</OL>
Sap flow measurements will be compared with eddy correlation measurements of H<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes above the forest. Simple models of forest productivity will be tested using data form the site: a "top-down" model of the Monteith type and a mechanistic "bottom-up" model, both developed in the laboratory.<br>
<IMG SRC="../../gifs/indent.gif">Forest inventories, geostatistic models and remote sensing data will be used to extend the plot measurement to the region.
<OL>
<LI>Diameter at breast height inventories will be used to extrapolate single trees transpiration measurements to the stand.
<LI>Extensive LAI measurements (from other teams will be used for geostatic purposes.
<li>Continuous and discrete algorithms of radiative transfer will be tested to derive surface parameters (PAR interception and LAI) from remote sensing data, and from cover maps. to extrapolate to the whole BOREAS region.
</OL>
Tentatively, we'll try to measure CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O exchange of the lichen layer at <A HREF="../../Sites1/SSA-OJP.html">SSA-OJP</A> using plastic enclosures, including a T/RH sensor, connected to a portable IRGA (collab. with <A HREF="TE-05.html">TE-5</A>).

<p>
<br>
<B>Objectives:</B><br>
To monitor transpiration and CO<sub>2</sub> exchanges of a forest stand over the whole growing season
<p>
<br>
<B>Type of Data Collected:</B><br>
<UL>
<LI>Sapflow measurements by a thermal method on 5 trees from day 121 to 258 (half-hourly measurements).
<LI>CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O exchanges of two branches using branch bags as cuvettes: nearly continuous measurements from day 206 to day 222 (half-hourly measurements)
<LI>sporadic measurements of CO<sub>2</sub> exchanges of the lichen layer using a small chamber (0.3 m by 0.3 m)
</UL>
<p>
<br>
<B>Equipment Used:</B><br>
<UL>
<LI>Sap flow sensors (made by A. Granier) + CR21X data logger and power supply
<LI>2 branch bags (with fans, temperature and relative humidity and PAR sensors) + IRGA for CO<sub>2</sub> (CID) + CR21X data logger
<LI>One lichen chamber (closed circuit) with temperature and PAR sensors, with a portable IRGA for CO<sub>2</sub> (PP systems)
</UL>
<p>
<br>
<B>Place of Measurement:</B><br>
SSA-OJP site in Nippawin (near TF5)
<p>
<B>Times of Measurement:</B><br>
Sapflow days: 121 to 258, 1994<br>
Branch bags: days 206 to 222, 1994<br>
Lichens: scattered data from July 24 to August 10, 1994
<p>
<B>Known Problems:</B><br>
Good functioning of sap flow sensors, with encouraging comparisons with micromet technique on a daily basis. For work on a half-hourly basis, sap flow lags about one hour to one hour and a half behind transpiration (likely variations in plant water storage). Branch bags gave also a good data set, but measured transpiration appears too small. We do not yet have a good scheme for deriving CO<sub>2</sub> exchange of the stand from both (sap flow and branch bags) datasets.<br>
