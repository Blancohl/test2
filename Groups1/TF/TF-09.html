<B>Objectives:</B> To measure and model the CO<sub>2</sub> exchanges of boreal black spruce forest and to determine  whether the soils and vegetation are significant global sinks for atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. Stand CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes were measured using eddy covariance and respiration components were measured using chamber based techniques. The CO<sub>2</sub> concentration profile were also measured to allow estimation of the atmospheric storage of CO<sub>2</sub> within the canopy.  Further measurements of the photosynthetic components and of stand structure and radiation properties were obtained by collaboration with other groups.  These measurements will be used to construct carbon budgets and to test models (especially Maestro) that will be used to scale up the carbon budgets in space and time.

<B>Objectives:</B><br>
To measure and model the CO<sub>2</sub> exchanges of boreal black spruce forest to determine whether the soils and vegetation are significant global sinks for atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. Stand CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes were measured using eddy covariance and the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration profile was also measured to allow estimation of the atmospheric storage of CO<sub>2</sub> within the canopy. These measurements will be used to verify scaling up procedures from leaf level measurements and may be scaled up to regional scales.

<B>Types of Data Collected and Equipment Used:</B><br>
<UL>
<LI>Stand fluxes (sensible and latent heat, momentum and CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes) by eddy covariance using Solent 3 axis sonic anemometer, LI COR LI 6262 IRGA (infrared gas analyzer) and the University of Edinburgh's EddySol software.
<LI>CO<sub>2</sub> storage in the canopy by measuring CO<sub>2</sub> concentration profiles using solenoid switched sampling from five heights to an ADC 225 IRGA.
<LI>Soil CO<sub>2</sub> efflux using open chambers multiplexed to a LI COR LI 6252 IRGA.
<LI>Stem CO<sub>2</sub> efflux using open chambers and an ADC LCA3 IRGA.

<B>Measurement Sites and Periods:</B><br>
All measurements were made at the Southern Study Area Old Black Spruce site. The measurements were made almost continuously from 23 May until 19 September 1994 except the soil and stem CO<sub>2</sub> efflux, which were made at sub intervals of the above period.
<p>
<B>Known Problems and Caveats:</B><br>
Eddy covariance is used to measure the flux through a horizontal plane, placed above the canopy. In very stable conditions, i.e. cloudless nights with little wind, there is almost no such flux. In such conditions the storage of CO<sub>2</sub> in the canopy is measured to estimate the flux in and out of the biological system. However, in extremely stable conditions this storage of CO<sub>2</sub> also appears to be underestimated. Simple modeling can be used to circumvent this problem.
