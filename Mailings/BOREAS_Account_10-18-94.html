Subject: Accessing Data from your BOREAS user account


There are now two ways to get at the BOREAS data in its new location: 
   1) Log onto your USER account on the BOREAS.GSFC.NASA.GOV (IP address
      128.183.76.149) system and follow through the menu system provided
<B>or</B>
   2) Make an FTP connection to your USER account and then set your directory
      accordingly.

If you have any comments about these, please send them to <A HREF="mailto:beth@ltpmail.gsfc.nasa.gov">Beth McCowan
(beth@ltpmail.gsfc.nasa.gov)</A>.

Once you have made a telnet or DECnet connection to BOREAS, you need to enter
your USER account name and password.  These accounts were established more
than a year ago and the PIs were supplied with their account names and initial
passwords around that time.  In most but not all cases, the account name was
your last name.  If you do not remember your account or password, please
contact <A HREF="mailto:young@boreas.gsfc.nasa.gov">Tony Young (young@boreas.gsfc.nasa.gov)</A> or <A HREF="mailto:beth@ltpmail.gsfc.nasa.gov">Beth McCowan
(beth@ltpmail.gsfc.nasa.gov)</A>.  

Once you are logged on, you will be placed into a menu with several options
(as shown below).

Under the BORIS FUNCTIONS is the BORIS option which will connect you to the
BOREAS data and software storage area.  After selecting the BORIS option, you
will be given a menu that looks like the one below. The options here allow you to
explore the existing directories, display available files to your screen, and
make an FTP connection to your home machine to download files.


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
        The following functions are available to search for data
        and transfer files:

        TREE         Generate the downward directory tree
        UP           Move up one directory level
        DOWN         Move down one directory level

        DIRS         List the subdirectories of this directory
        FILES        List the files in this directory
        VIEW         Type a file to view its contents on screen

        FTP          Run FTP to transfer files to your home machine

        EXIT         Exit this module to main screen
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Please type a command >:


The current directory structure provides areas for each group (e.g., TE) and
STAFF data sets along with subsequent sub-directories for each team (e.g.,
TE06).  At this time, not all of the directories contain data since we have
not necessarily received data from every group.  Our goal is to eventually
have a file named 0_README.TXT (the first character is a zero) in all the
directories; even the empty ones to give some overview of status information
and directory contents.  Each of the 0_README.TXT files will have a date as
the first record to indicate when it was last changed or updated for your
reference.  For those directories that reference image or other 'large volume'
data sets that cannot be kept on-line, inventory information will be provided
for you to call or email in your orders.

<H4><A NAME="FTP Connection">Making an FTP Connection to Your User Account</A></H4>
Assuming that you have the appropriate FTP software, you can initiate an FTP
connection to your user account on the BOREAS system, change your current
default directory to the BOREAS data areas, and pull files to your system.
First you must start up an FTP connection to BOREAS.GSFC.NASA.GOV.  Once
you have the connection:

1) Enter USER followed by your USER account name;
2) Enter your account password at the prompt;  At this point you should be
   logged into your top level directory on thE BOREAS system.
3) Enter cd BOREAS_DATA:[BOREAS] to change your current directory to the
   BOREAS data and software storage area;
4) From this point you can move around the directories and gather the files
   you desire with the basic FTP command set.
