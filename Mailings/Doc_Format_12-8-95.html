To:      All BOREAS Investigators and Staff

From:    Jeff Newcomer, BOREAS Information Scientist

Subject: Data Set Documentation Changes

At the October Workshop, I mentioned changes that were being worked out with
the ORNL DAAC regarding data set documentation. BORIS has accepted the ORNL DAAC
Guide Document format to help improve the transfer of data from BORIS to the
DAAC.  Since the Guide Document format meets the overall DAAC requirements,
the ORNL DAAC will have much less manual conversion to perform if the BOREAS
data set documentation comes to them in the needed format.  Also as I mentioned
at the workshop, the Guide Document content is essentially the same as the
existing BOREAS document outline that was previously distributed to you.  At
this point, as you update any existing documentation or supply initial
documentation to BORIS, we will require you to submit the documentation in
the new Guide Document Format to consider it in our tabulation of 'Delivered
Documentation'.

<HR>
<H4><A NAME="Creating Data Docs">Notes on Creating Data Set Documents</A></H4> 
In addition to sending you the Guide Document outline, BORIS has prepared a
look-up table for you to use in moving sections from your existing BOREAS
documents to the new format.  Both of these items are included at the end of
this message.  Lastly, we ask that you follow the following guidelines in
developing your documents.

1) Left justify all text and section headings
2) Do not mix graphics in with the text.  We are still working on details
   regarding graphics.  For now, please submit digital versions in separate
   files and clear hardcopy versions of any graphics you refer to in the text
   sections and leave a labeled/designated space for the graphic's inclusion.
3) Do not use tabs for formatting tables.  Please use blank spaces to get the
   desired spacing.
4) Let text lines wrap naturally unless specific line breaks are required for
   tables and new paragraphs.
5) Set your margins to allow a maximum of 80 characters per line and use a
   fixed width font rather than proportional ones.  We suggest using a 10 pt
   Courier font with left and right margins of 1.0 and 0.8 inches, respectively.
6) When using acronyms, spell them out first followed by the acronym in
   parentheses.  Please include all acronyms in Section 19 in alphabetic order.
7) Use dates in the form of dd-mon-yyyy (e.g., 10-JAN-1994).  Day of Year may
   be used but also include this standard date format.
8) References in section 17 should be left justfied and allow the text lines
   to wrap naturally as the other text.  Separate references with blank text
   lines.
