To:      All BOREAS Investigators and Staff

From:    Jeff Newcomer, BOREAS Information Scientist
         [(301) 286-7858] [<A HREF="mailto:newcomer@ltpmail.gsfc.nasa.gov">newcomer@ltpmail.gsfc.nasa.gov</A>]

Subject: Miscellaneous Items, Establishment of Bulletin Board Facilities, 
         and Introductory Help Information

<HR>
<H4><A NAME="Revised BOR_CORD">Slightly Revised Version of BOR_CORD Software</A></H4>
Based on some feedback from staff, the BOR_CORD software was modified to output
the coordinate values in the same order that it requests them for input.  This
modification should ease manipulations of output coordinates for use as
subsequent input.  The new version (2.2) is available under the on-line 
software directories.

<HR>
<H4><A NAME="EMail Groups">Electronic Mail Groups</A></H4>
We are compiling lists of e-mail addresses that can be useful for group mailings.
The current plan is to establish mail groups for the currently defined AFM, 
HYD, RSS, TE, TF, and TGB groups.  I am sure that we will not have e-mail
addresses for everyone who is working within these groups; especially graduate
assistants. In the next week or so, we will use the compiled lists to make a
group mailing. We will include all the names in the list as part of the test
message.  If you discover that someone is missing from the list or has an
incorrect e-mail address, please contact me.  If there are other e-mail groups 
you would like to have created, please contact me.

<HR>
<H4><A NAME="Data Transfer">Electronic Transfer of Data to BORIS</A></H4>
We have established a basic service to receive small data sets via network
transfer.  Our current definition of small is 10 Mbytes or less.  We can be
flexible but decided on 10 Mbytes as a good starting figure.  This will be a
supervised sort of activity with: 1) you letting us know that you want to
transfer some data and describing it to your BORIS contact, 2) Setting up of a
directory by BORIS staff to receive the data, 3) Informing you of the account,
password, and directory in which to put the data, 4) your login and transfer of
the data, and 5) Checking of the transferred files by your BORIS contact.  If 
you want to make use of this, contact your BORIS rep.

<HR>
<H4><A NAME="BBS">BOREAS Bulletin Boards</A></H4>
In response to several requests, BORIS staff have implemented bulletin boards 
on the BOREAS system.  Currently the following bulletin boards are in place:

GENERAL, BORIS, AFM, HYD, RSS, TE, TF, and TGB.  Any messages posted to the
established bulletin boards will have a default life of 90 days.  If other
bulletin boards are desired, please let us know and we will work with you to
implement them.

You access the bulletin boards by entering 'BULL' at the prompt in the main 
BORIS menu as shown below.

   This function acts as a bulletin board allowing users

   HELP, the name of the function, and press <Return>.
   Some of the commonly used functions are described below.
   The MAIL utility can also be accessed through BULLETIN

names of the various bulletin boards/folders, enter DIR/FOLDERS and you will see
the following:

Jeff ... I think your example of adding a message to the bulletin
board is much too simplistic.  It cannot be as easy as you indicate.

To delete a message that you posted, enter DEL or DEL/IMM #.  If you enter 'DEL',
the message will be marked for deletion 15 minutes from the time you issue the
delete command.  This allows you to UNDELETE the message if you change your mind.
Entering DEL/IMM causes immediate deletion.
