To:      All BOREAS Investigators and Staff

From:    Jeff Newcomer, BOREAS Information Scientist
         [(301) 286-7858] [<A HREF="mailto:newcomer@ltpmail.gsfc.nasa.gov">newcomer@ltpmail.gsfc.nasa.gov</A>]

Subject: General Information and E-mail Lists and Help Information

<H4><A NAME="BOREAS Data">Current BOREAS Data Holdings</A> (Feb 24, 1995)</H4>
The data holdings on the system are growing and access to the data seems to be
going pretty smoothly.  January was apparently a slow month with 29 logins, 42
data transfers, and 643.91 Kbytes of data transfered.  February so far has 
shown much more activity with 90 logins, 200 transfers, and 42.85 Mbytes
transfered.  We have responded to several account creation and update requests
and worked with trouble areas to get over any humps that you may have had.
Please continue to contact <A HREF="mailto:beth@ltpmail.gsfc.nasa.gov">Beth McCowan</A> with your questions on data access 
and availability.

Thanks to all of you who tolerated our E-mail list testing last week and for 
the feedback we received.  I received about 100 messages this past week from 
the tests and have incorporated the changes.  In performing the updates, I
noticed that several of you are included in multiple mail group lists.  This 
is not a problem, but this may result in you getting duplicate mailings at times.

The two purposes of this is letter are to notify you that the E-mail groups are
ready for your use and to provide you with some help information in using them.
I am sure that some further address revisions are needed, but we will update
them as they become known.  If you have a system change, please let us know as
soon as possible so we can keep the lists current.  The E-mail groups that have
been established include:

<A HREF="mailto:AFM@boreas.gsfc.nasa.gov">AFM</A> - Addresses for all known BOREAS AFM participants
<A HREF="mailto:HYD@boreas.gsfc.nasa.gov">HYD</A> - Addresses for all known BOREAS HYD participants
<A HREF="mailto:RSS@boreas.gsfc.nasa.gov">RSS</A> - Addresses for all known BOREAS RSS participants
<A HREF="mailto:TE@boreas.gsfc.nasa.gov">TE</A>  - Addresses for all known BOREAS TE participants
<A HREF="mailto:TF@boreas.gsfc.nasa.gov">TF</A>  - Addresses for all known BOREAS TF participants
<A HREF="mailto:TGB@boreas.gsfc.nasa.gov">TGB</A> - Addresses for all known BOREAS TGB participants

<A HREF="mailto:BOREAS_STAFF@boreas.gsfc.nasa.gov">BOREAS_STAFF</A> - Addresses for all GSFC BOREAS staff personnel
<A HREF="mailto:BORIS_STAFF@boreas.gsfc.nasa.gov">BORIS_STAFF</A>  - Addresses for all GSFC BORIS staff personnel

These groups can be augmented and updated as needed.  One that we thought of but
have not implemented is an address list for all team and staff personnel.  If
you think this should be set up, please let us know.  An example mail session
follows.


You can access the mail facility by entering 'MAIL' at the prompt in the main
BORIS menu as shown below or from the DCL '$' prompt that appears when you exit
the main menu.

MAIL>



<B>Sending a message to one or more people not in an established email group.</B>
The trick here is specifying the proper syntax of Internet addresses to the VAX
system which uses DECNet as a base.  Note that each internet address needs to be
preceded by the SMTP% characters and the address itself must be enclosed in a
pair of double quotation marks "" as shown.

Enter SEND at the mail prompt.
Enter the email address(es).
Enter your Subject at the SUBJECT prompt
Enter your message.
Enter Control-Z to end and send message.

MAIL> SEND
To:     SMTP%"newcomer@ltpmail.gsfc.nasa.gov", SMTP%"fred@ltpmail.gsfc.nasa.gov"
Subj:   EXAMPLE MESSAGE
Enter your message below. Press CTRL/Z when complete, or CTRL/C to quit:

This is an example of sending a message to a list of individuals.

MAIL>



<B>Sending an existing file.</B>
The trick here is to specify the name of the file in the SEND command as shown.
Note that when you send an existing file, the mail system does not prompt you
to enter a message of your own after the SUBJECT line.

Enter SEND 'filename' at the mail prompt.
Enter the email address(es) or email group name.
Enter your Subject at the SUBJECT prompt

MAIL> SEND TEST.MSG
To:     smtp%"newcomer@ltpmail.gsfc.nasa.gov"
Subj:   Example of sending a file via mail
