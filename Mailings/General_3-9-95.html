To:      All BOREAS Investigators and Staff

From:    Jeff Newcomer, BOREAS Information Scientist
         [(301) 286-7858] [<A HREF="mailto:newcomer@ltpmail.gsfc.nasa.gov">newcomer@ltpmail.gsfc.nasa.gov</A>]

Subject: Email Aliases and WWW Access

Based on the feedback we received about the initial E-mail capabilities, we
have added a set of E-mail aliases (or 'exploders' as some people call them)
for use.  We have tested the staff lists successfully and except for some
possible missed syntax errors, the other lists should work as well.

The E-mail aliases that have been established include:

<A HREF="mailto:AFM@boreas.gsfc.nasa.gov">AFM</A> - Addresses for all known BOREAS AFM participants
<A HREF="mailto:HYD@boreas.gsfc.nasa.gov">HYD</A> - Addresses for all known BOREAS HYD participants
<A HREF="mailto:RSS@boreas.gsfc.nasa.gov">RSS</A> - Addresses for all known BOREAS RSS participants
<A HREF="mailto:TE@boreas.gsfc.nasa.gov">TE</A>  - Addresses for all known BOREAS TE participants
<A HREF="mailto:TF@boreas.gsfc.nasa.gov">TF</A>  - Addresses for all known BOREAS TF participants
<A HREF="mailto:TGB@boreas.gsfc.nasa.gov">TGB</A> - Addresses for all known BOREAS TGB participants

<A HREF="mailto:BOREAS_STAFF@boreas.gsfc.nasa.gov">BOREAS_STAFF</A> - Addresses for all GSFC BOREAS staff personnel
<A HREF="mailto:BORIS_STAFF@boreas.gsfc.nasa.gov">BORIS_STAFF</A>  - Addresses for all GSFC BORIS staff personnel


To use these, send your message to ALIAS@boreas.gsfc.nasa.gov where ALIAS is
any of the ones listed above.  Any delivery difficulties, bad addresses,
etc. will be returned to a system account on the boreas.gsfc.nasa.gov
system.  We will check the account regularly to be sure that any mail
troubles are settled as quickly as possible.

BORIS has established a preliminary set of BOREAS World-Wide Web pages.
They can be viewed with any Web browser program (such as NCSA Mosaic or
Netscape) connected to the Internet. The pages are located at:
<A HREF="../BOREAS_Home.html">http://boreas.gsfc.nasa.gov/</A>

They contain a description of the BOREAS project, the Science Teams,
Preliminary Results for 1994, and digitized photographs from the various
sites.  They will be expanding and changing as we add more photographs,
more links, more maps, more figures, and other things.  The current
long-term plan is to also provide access to the 'cleaned up' BOREAS data
via this means.

If you would like to send comments on the BOREAS pages, or find any glaring
errors, please e-mail <A HREF="mailto:landis@ltpmail.gsfc.nasa.gov">David Landis at "landis@ltpmail.gsfc.nasa.gov"</A>. If
you know of any related WWW pages that we should link to and/or if you have
any digital maps of the BOREAS region (any scale, including site maps) and
would like to contribute them, please send e-mail to David with that
information as well (please include the complete URL address of the
starting page and where it should go in the BOREAS pages).
