         June 2, 1995

To:      All BOREAS Investigators and Staff

From:    Jeff Newcomer, BOREAS Information Scientist
         [(301) 286-7858] [<A HREF="mailto:newcomer@ltpmail.gsfc.nasa.gov">newcomer@ltpmail.gsfc.nasa.gov</A>]

Subject:    Various Items and WWW Access to Data

<HR>
<H4><A NAME="Ops Doc">BOREAS 1994 Operations Document</A></H4>
We have not yet received all of the one page write ups from the science teams 
that are needed for compiling the Operations Document.  The current goal is to
have a full draft of the document by June 30.  GSFC staff are working on their
portions and need your contributions to fill in needed areas.  If you are 
unsure what is required, contact your group leader or Fred Huemmrich
[<A HREF="mailto:fred@ltpmail.gsfc.nasa.gov">fred@ltpmail.gsfc.nasa.gov</A> or (301)286-4862].

<HR>
<H4><A NAME="Doc Files">Extra Data and Documentation Files</A></H4>
Several people have been sending multiple versions/formats of data and
documentation files in their submissions (e.g., a text file of the data and 
an Excel spreadsheet file of the data).  It is clear that the intent is to be 
sure that BORIS gets a copy of the data and documentation that we can use
effectively.  In most of these cases, we could have used just about any one 
of the formats sent.  However, by sending multiple versions it adds additional
effort for us in checking the extra files to be sure that they all contain the
same information and in inventorying all the extra files we receive.  The best
situation from our perspective would be to send only one version that has been
approved by the BORIS group representative.  If you have questions about this,
please contact your BORIS group representative or me.

<HR>
<H4><A NAME="EMail Lists">Updating Our E-mail Lists</A></H4>
We plan to continue to use our current email lists and aliases to send out
information like this to you.  If you are aware of someone who should be 
getting these mailings but is not, please contact us.  The lists are only as 
good as their contents.

<HR>
<H4><A NAME="Time Conversion">Time Conversion Reference Chart</A></H4>
The following chart provides an example time conversion for standard and daylight
savings time periods in 1993, 1994, and 1995 from local times at the SSA and NSA
to GMT.  For most of you this may be information you already have and know but
for those of us shoveling data of various sorts, we have found it to be handy in
checking dates and times and encourage you to use it also.

Daylight Savings Time Dates
April 4 - October 31, 1993
April 2 - October 30, 1994
April 3 - October 31, 1995

                   GMT       Maryland       Manitoba   Saskatchewan
Standard Time     1300          0800          0700         0700
Daylight Savings  1300          0900          0800         0700

In a nutshell:
  - both the NSA and SSA are 6 hours behind GMT during standard time.
  - the NSA and SSA are 5 and 6 hours behind GMT, respectively, during
    daylight savings.

<HR>
<H4><A NAME="Data Formatter">Data Documentor and Data Formatter Software</A></H4>
We have been having an increasing number of questions and problems reported about
the Data Documentor and Data Formatter software utilities.  Based on the FIFE
Information System effort, these utilities seemed like a good idea and to a
limited extent have at least partially fulfilled their mission.  Your use of 
them has provided us with information and ideas about improvements to continue
their viability and to improve them.  However, we do not have the resources to
maintain and improve them at this time and the ASCII documents and tabular ASCII
data files being received are working out well.  Essentially if these programs
work for you and you are happy with them, you can continue to use them.  If you
have problems with them, we strongly encourage you to output the data files as
tabular comma separated ASCII files and the documentation as simple ASCII text
files.

<HR>
<H4><A NAME="WWW Data Access">Access to Data via the World-Wide Web (WWW)</A></H4>
As of June 5, BOREAS data will be available through the World-Wide Web. You will
have access to the BOREAS data though the BOREAS Web pages directly, with the
Netscape Web browser.

Netscape is the only Web browser currently available that can make FTP connections
to a VAX (which is where the BOREAS data is stored). NCSA Mosaic does not work
with VAXes running VMS and Multinet. Several browsers were tested, and only
Netscape worked correctly.

Using the current access restrictions, only BOREAS Investigators and their
associates can currently access the BOREAS data. Therefore the data is PASSWORD
PROTECTED, and can only be accessed by people who know the current password.  
The current password can be obtained by connecting to the BOREAS.GSFC.NASA.GOV
system, logging on to your  user account, and accessing the available electronic
Bulletin Board.  BORIS will periodically change the password to enforce data
security. As part of the BOREAS project, you will be informed of any password
change via email.  At that time you will need to access the bulletin board to
obtain the new password.  Alternately, you can call Ms. Beth McCowan at the
BOREAS Information System (301) 286-4005, 0900 to 1700 EST to receive the 
current password.  Please help us maintain the needed data security and do not
share this password with anyone not associated with the BOREAS Project.  An
example session of getting the password is contained at the end of this message.

               How to Download BOREAS Data With Netscape
               -----------------------------------------

Accessing the BOREAS Data
-------------------------
The first time an FTP link is activated to the data by Netscape, you will be
prompted for the password. Once this has been entered, you will not be asked 
for it again until you start a totally new Netscape session.

Viewing and Downloading Files
-----------------------------
Once connected, you will be in the directory for the team you requested, viewing 
a list of data files. Simply click on a file to download and display that file
within Netscape. You will then have to save that file to your computer (using 
the "Save As..." command). This process must be repeated for each file desired.

Navigating in the FTP Archive
-----------------------------
You can move around in the directory structure simply by clicking on a new
directory (a name ending in a slash /) or the line "Up to higher level directory"
at the top of each page. You cannot go any higher in the directory structure than
the "boreas/" directory.


             How to Download BOREAS Data With an FTP Browser
             -----------------------------------------------
You may want to use a standalone FTP browser (like Fetch for the Macintosh) to
access the data. You must connect to the computer "BOREAS.GSFC.NASA.GOV",
using the account name "BOREAS_PRE" and the password given in the electronic
bulletin board. Once connected, you will be in the root directory and should go
into the "data/" directory to see a listing of BOREAS Teams. From there you
should be able to find the data you want.


Downloading Netscape
--------------------
The Netscape Web Browser is available through Anonymous FTP at the following
sites:

Host                    Directory
----                    ---------
ftp.netscape.com        /netscape1.1/
ftp2.netscape.com       /netscape1.1/
ftp.micro.caltech.edu   /pub/netscape/
unicron.unomaha.edu     /pub/netscape/netscape1.1/
server.berkeley.edu     /pub/netscape/
ftp.orst.edu            /pub/packages/netscape/



Example Session to obtain the Password
