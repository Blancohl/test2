<B>June 18, 1996</B> -- There are numerous fires burning in the <A HREF="Sites1/SSA.html">Southern Study Area (click here to see map)</A>.  It looks like none of them pose a major threat to BOREAS sites at present, but we will be keeping an eye on them. There are several fires in Prince Albert National Park (PANP), including a large fire burning out of control near Crean Lake (northern PANP).  Also, fires in the center of the SSA caused Rt. 913 to be closed late last week, but has been reopened now.<br>
<IMG SRC="gifs/indent.gif"><B>For BOREAS Investigators:</B> It is a good idea to get a fire update before leaving for the field.  You can visit the <A HREF="http://www.nofc.forestry.ca/fire/cwfis/fwi/index.html">Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index System (CFFWIS)</A> for current fire maps of Canada, or contact <A HREF="mailto:danhod@ltpmail.gsfc.nasa.gov">Dan Hodkinson</A> (301-286-3621) or the Saskatchewan Natural Resource office in Smeaton (306-426-2611).
