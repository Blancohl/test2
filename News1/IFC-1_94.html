<br>
The first full-up Intensive Field Campaign (IFC-1) took place from 24 May through 16 June 1994.  At the outset of IFC-1, around 150 scientists were at work on the ground taking a wide range of meteorological, ecological, hydrological and remote sensing measurements.
<p>
At this point, the research aircraft committed to BOREAS constituted a small airforce which was committed to the <A HREF="/BOREAS/Sites1/SSA.html">SSA</A> for the first half  of IFC-1 (24 May through 6 June).  Four flux measurement aircraft (<A HREF="../Pictures1/General/King-Air.jpg">U. Wyoming Kingair</A>, NCAR Electra, <A HREF="../Pictures1/General/Twin-Otter.jpg">Canadian NRC Twin Otter</A>, <A HREF="../Pictures1/General/Long-EZ.jpg">NOAA Long EZ</A>) and three remote sensing aircraft (<A HREF="../Pictures1/General/C-130.jpg">NASA C-130</A>, <A HREF="../Pictures1/General/Helicopter.jpg">NASA Helicopter</A>, <A HREF="../Pictures1/General/Chieftain.jpg">Canada's Chieftain</A>) were based at Prince Albert airport or in nearby Saskatoon (<A HREF="../Pictures1/General/NCAR_Electra_25.jpg">NCAR Electra</A>).  The <A HREF="../Pictures1/General/ER-2.jpg">NASA ER-2</A> and <A HREF="../Pictures1/General/DC-8_big.gif">NASA DC-8</A> also flew missions over the study areas from Spokane, Washington and NASA/Ames Research Center, respectively.  The locally-based aircraft completed their assigned missions by 6 June 1994 after which, five of them; the <A HREF="../Pictures1/General/C-130.jpg">NASA C-130</A>, <A HREF="../Pictures1/General/Helicopter.jpg">NASA Helicopter</A>, <A HREF="../Pictures1/General/Chieftain.jpg">Chieftain</A>, <A HREF="../Pictures1/General/King-Air.jpg">Kingair</A> and <A HREF="../Pictures1/General/Twin-Otter.jpg">Twin Otter</A>, moved the 400 miles up to the <A HREF="../Sites1/NSA.html">NSA</A> to complete a large number of missions there in two days of clear weather on 6-8 June 1994.  A huge forest fire just north of the <A HREF="../Sites1/NSA.html">NSA</A> trailed a smoke plume over the study area for a few days near the end of IFC-1, which closed down remote sensing work but, fortunately, was extinguished before roasting any investigators or equipment.
