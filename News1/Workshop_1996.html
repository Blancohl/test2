<H3>BOREAS Workshop in Toronto(May 1996)</H3>
</center>
BOREAS investigators met at University of Toronto, St. George Campus, Toronto, Canada for an important meeting and workshop, from May 21, 1996 to May 25, 1996. This was used to report on team activities and findings for FFC-W '96 and IFC-1 '96, and to make detailed plans for IFC-2' 96 and IFC-3 '96.
