<H3>Introduction</H3>
<P>
Exceptionally high cosmic radiation was observed in the 
southern study area (SSA) of BOREAS during a three-day period in 
September 1994.  The radiation values were observed during aerial 
surveying to measure the soil moisture along established BOREAS 
flight lines. Such high input of cosmic radiation is considered to 
be a rare event, and could affect radiation measurements by other 
BOREAS scientists. This report has been prepared to discuss how 
the radiation data were observed and to present information on the 
temporal and spatial variation in the cosmic radiation.
<P>
<br>
<H3>Airborne Gamma Radiation System</H3>
<P>
The National Weather Service (NWS) airborne gamma radiation 
system is used in the BOREAS study.  For the benefit of those not 
familiar with the system a brief description of the NWS airborne 
system follows.  Primarily the purpose of the NWS system is to 
provide information on the energy levels of gamma radiation 
emitted from the surface of the earth.  The NWS airborne system is 
used by HYD-6 of BOREAS to measure the soil moisture (SM) of the 
mineral soil, the water content (WC) of the moss/humus layer, and 
the amount of standing water (SW) and by HYD-4 to measure the 
water equivalent (WE) of the snow cover.  The NWS system uses two 
NaI(Tl) detectors.  The first detector is up-looking and consists 
of two 10.2 x 10.2 x 20.3 cm detectors.  The up-looking detector 
measures gamma radiation having energy levels from 3.00 to 5.12 
mev.  The second detector consist of five down-looking detectors 
of the same size.  Photo multiplier tubes associated with the 
detectors, provide radiation data for determining a gamma energy 
spectrum for each survey.<br>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">Counts-per-minute (cpm) values for three radiation windows 
are derived from the average energy spectrum for each flight line.  
The radiation windows are the Potassium (40K) window (from 1.37 to 
1.57 mev), the Thallium (208Tl) window (from 2.42 to 2.82 mev) and 
the Gross Count (GC) window (from 0.42 to 3.00 mev). The cpm data 
for each window, compared to background calibration data values, 
are used to compute estimates of the SM and WE of the snow cover 
and other variables.  Stripping techniques are used to compute the 
counts in the K and Tl windows representing the number of 
uncolided K and Tl gamma radiation counts received by the down-
looking detector that originate from the radioactive elements in 
the ground.  The Gross count is a measure of all gammas in its 
energy window.  The observed GC counts from the down-looking 
detector are corrected for gammas produced by radon and by cosmic 
radiation using measurements from the up-looking detector.<br>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">The final GC values are generally fairly stable and reliable 
for use with the estimates from the K and Tl windows in estimating 
SM.  In some countries, that do not have the special detectors as 
does the NWS, only GC counts are used for determining estimates of 
the SM or the WE of the snow cover.<br>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">The standard NWS procedure is to use weighted values of the 
K, Tl and GC corrected counts to determine final SM and WE 
estimates.  During analyses of the BOREAS airborne radiation data, 
using the standard NWS weights, very high cosmic counts from the 
up-looking detector resulted in estimates of negative soil 
moisture for some of the flight lines during the three days in 
September 1944.  For these particular days the in-situ SM was the 
lowest observed during the BOREAS study.<br>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">During the FIFE experiment conducted near Manhattan, Kansas 
in 1987 and 1989, revised weighting factors for short flight lines 
were developed using only the K and Tl windows for estimating SM.   
The revised FIFE weights have been used to calculate SM estimates 
for all BOREAS surveys.  Thus, the high cosmic radiation readings 
do not affect the BOREAS estimates of SM.  The computed estimates 
of SM using the revised FIFE weights correlate well with those 
computed using the standard NWS weights (including the GC window) 
except for the three-day period in September 1994. 
<P>
<br>
<H3>High Cosmic Radiation Values</H3> 
<P>     
In the BOREAS SSA there are 24 flight lines for the soil 
moisture measurement program by HYD-6 (these flight lines and 
others are used for the snow measurement program by HYD-4)  The 24 
flight lines are divided into 90 segments (bins) to provide 
measurements on a smaller scale.  Not all lines are measured each 
day during field operations.  Special attention is given to those 
flight lines established over or near the primary BOREAS tower 
sites.<br>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">For three days in September 1994 (8th - 10th) many of the 
cosmic radiation measurements from the up-looking detector for 
segments of flight lines (bins) in the SSA were significantly 
greater than all other measurements made during BOREAS.
<A HREF="#Table_1">Table 1</A> 
is a summary of all up-looking detector counts-per-minute observed 
during the entire BOREAS study (including measurement over the 
northern study area and along the transect between the two areas).  
The first three columns of numbers are those recorded over the SSA 
by the up-looking detector for the three days in September 1944 
when the high radiation was observed.  On 8 September 41 bins were 
surveyed.  Of these 24 had high cosmic counts that averaged 1,389 
with a standard deviation of 63.9.  On 9 September 51 bins were 
surveyed in the SSA and 30 had cosmic counts that averaged 1,420 
with a standard deviation of 37.9.  On both days a couple of 
flight lines with high cosmic values also had 1 or more bin values 
that were less, but higher (about 500 counts-per-minute) than 
values for other flight lines that averaged only slightly more 
than 200 cpm.<br>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">On 10 September 40 bins were surveyed and high cosmic 
radiation cpm (averaged 1,383 with a standard deviation of 40.8) 
were observed for all bins in the entire SSA.  The high counts on 
these three days contrast sharply with the average cpm of 188 
(standard deviation of 20.3) for all other BOREAS measurements 
(1,643 bins). 
<P>
<br>
<H3>Aerial Extent of High Cosmic Radiation</H3>
<P>
Airborne surveys were conducted over the SSA during 
September 1993, February 1944, and during July, August and 
September 1994.  No high radiation values were observed for any 
bin of any  flight line in the entire BOREAS study area prior to 8 
September.  <A HREF="Peck_Figure_1.gif">Figure 1</A> shows the SSA area of BOREAS that had high 
cosmic radiation on 8 September.  For some flight lines, i. e., 
BP102 immediately east of Prince Albert National Park, only 4 of 
the 5 flight line bins had high radiation values providing fairly 
precise information on the edge of the high radiation.  In the 
area just east of Candle Lake flight lines CR960 and BP113 had all 
high values on 8 September and BP114 just to the north had only 
low values. <br>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">The area of high cosmic radiation increased by 9 September, 
<A HREF="Peck_Figure_2.gif">Figure 2</A>.  The high value area included part of additional 
northern flight lines (BP114, BP117) and extending south and to 
the east of flight line CR960.  However, flight line BP113 to the 
north of CR960 changed from high to low values.<br>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">On 10 September every measured bin in the SSA had high cosmic 
radiation.  No airborne gamma radiation measurements are available 
after 10 September.  
<P>
<br>
<H3>Accuracy and Consistency of Measurements</H3>
<P>
When very unusual measurements of radiation are observed, 
questions are generally raised pertaining to the accuracy and 
consistency of the measurements.  Often the calibration of the 
sensors used, changes in observers, different measuring 
techniques, and different platforms for the radiation sensors are 
reasons why unusual data are often questioned.  In this case, the 
same pilots, using the same aircraft and the same sensors, 
conducted all BOREAS surveys.  The contrast in the observed cosmic 
radiation data on the 8th and 9th of September, and the definite 
patterns shown in <A HREF="Peck_Figure_1.gif">Figure 1</A> and <A HREF="Peck_Figure_2.gif">Figure 2</A>, says much about the relative 
accuracy and consistency of the measured cosmic data.
<P>
<br>
<H3>How Rare Are High Cosmic Counts</H3>
<P>
When the high cosmic counts were encounter the question of 
how unusual were the cosmic radiation measurements was raised.  
The NWS system using the up- and down-looking detectors has been 
operationally used since February 1979.  During the past 15 years 
records of airborne NWS surveys of more than 1,600 flight lines 
covering portions of 25 states and 7 Canadian Provinces have been 
stored in an operational data base. The up-looking cosmic 
radiation records from approximately 14,000 flight line surveys in 
the data base were reviewed and all  counts of 500 or greater were 
selected (743 cases). None of the 743 cases were observed in 
Canada or in the northern tier of US states where large counts had 
been thought possible. <br>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">The only locations to have the large cosmic counts were 
flight lines in the states of California, Colorado, Utah and 
Wyoming, where most of the flight lines are at elevations much 
higher than those in the BOREAS study area.  Of the 743 selected 
records only 81 cases have values of 800 or more (with a single 
high value of 1,022 cpm).  Cosmic radiation observed at a high 
elevation would be expected to have higher counts as a result of 
less atmosphere above the flight line.   A simple plot of the 
average cosmic cpm versus elevation shows a high correlation 
between the cpm and elevation.<br>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/indent.gif">With no observed cases of cosmic cpm greater than should be 
expected from the cpm versus elevation plot for all 14,000 
historical cases,  the occurrence of the high radiation valules is 
very to be very unusual.  In a brief discussion with J. Trombka, a 
NASA Space Physics scientist of Goddard Space Flight Center, he 
advised that the high cosmic radiation could be a very rarely 
measured event.  
<P>
<br>
<H3>Origin of the Cosmic Radiation</H3> 
<P>
There has not been time to investigate or to discuss the high 
cosmic radiation values or the patterns that have been observed 
with many other space and basic physicists.   It is noted, that 
during the BOREAS field campaign in September 1994 heavy auroura 
borealis activity was observed.  J. Trombka suggested that the 
observed cosmic rays are probably solar protons that originate 
during solar flares at energy levels of about 100 mev and decrease 
to the measured values of 3.00 to 5.12 mev due to a process called 
Brehmstralung.  He also said that the cosmic rays would align with 
the magnetic field lines of the earth and thus arrive at the earth 
in definite patterns.  A retired physicist (C. Fields) 
hypothesized that the changes in the daily patterns in <A HREF="Peck_Figure_1.gif">Figure 1</A> 
and <A HREF="Peck_Figure_2.gif">Figure 2</A> could possibly be related to changes in the earth's magnetic 
field due to small shifts in the magma of the earth.  The authors 
are not space physicists and those who may be interested in 
learning more about the records or in providing the authors with 
additional information are cordially invite to contact them.

<H3>Effects on Other BOREAS Observation</H3>
<P>
The occurrence of high cosmic radiation may affect radiation 
or other measurements by BOREAS investigators.  The authors are 
interested in any studies of0 the effect of the high cosmic 
radiation on other measurements.
