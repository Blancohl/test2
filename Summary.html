<H2>Summary of Results From BOREAS</H2>
<p>
The 1993-1994 BOREAS field year has been completed.  In terms of data
acquisition, the effort must be considered a great success with the collection
of comprehensive surface, airborne and satellite data sets accomplished almost exactly as planned; the few blank spots being due to smoke contamination of some of the optical remote sensing work in IFC-2 and similar problems with daytime clouds in IFC-1.  Surface flux data were collected throughout the growing season from the towers using eddy correlation and other techniques and over 350 research flights (remote sensing and airborne eddy correlation) were flown in support of the operation.<br>
<IMG SRC="gifs/indent.gif">A surprising picture of the energy, water and carbon dynamics of the boreal
ecosystem is emerging, even at this early stage in the experiment.  In simple
terms, the lowland forests of the boreal ecosystem in Saskatchewan and Manitoba
grow on flat terrain, with a mineral soil base overlain by a very thin layer of
live and decomposed moss.  Observations show that the root zone of the
conifers, which comprise the bulk of these forested lowlands, is very thin
(less than 40 cm deep) and is contained entirely within the live/decomposed moss
(moss/humus) layer.  In short, the boreal lowland soils behave hydrologically
much like a gently rolling semi-impermeable floor, with a thin layer of cotton
on top.<br>
<IMG SRC="gifs/indent.gif">In terms of the water and energy balance, we have seen that the boreal
ecosystem often behaves like an arid landscape, particularly early in the
growing season.  This is because even though the moss layer is wet for most of
the summer, the poor soils and harsh climatic conditions lead to low
photosynthetic rates, which in turn lead to low evapotranspiration rates.  Much
of the precipitation simply penetrates through the moss and sand to the
underlying semi-impermeable layer and runs off.  Most of the incoming solar
radiation is intercepted by the vegetation canopies, which exert strong control
over transpiration water losses, rather than by the moist underlying moss/soil
surface.  As a result, much of the available surface energy is dissipated as
sensible heat which often leads to the development of a deep (3000m) and
turbulent atmospheric boundary layer.  These insights into the partitioning of
the surface energy should have a significant impact on the development of
climate and weather models, most of which currently characterize the boreal
landscape as a freely evaporating surface.<br>
<IMG SRC="gifs/indent.gif">Importantly, it has been reported that the moisture level in the moss/humus
layer never gets low enough to induce moisture stress in the overlying
vegetation (<A HREF="Groups1/TE/TE-09.html">Margolis and colleagues; TE-9</A>).  If this finding holds up under
further analysis, it would imply that root zone moisture, a difficult variable
to quantify over large spatial scales, does not exert significant control on
the surface energy balance.  Rather, the important variables controlling
photosynthesis and evaporation appear to be soil temperature in the spring, and
atmospheric relative humidity and air temperature in the summer and fall.<br>
<IMG SRC="gifs/indent.gif">This new understanding of controls on regional evaporation rates is relevant to
the issue of whether the boreal ecosystem is a sink or source of carbon, but
until the analysis is further along this question will remain unresolved.  We
have learned that sequestration of carbon by conifers, the largest component of
the boreal ecosystem, is limited in the spring by frozen or cold soils, and in
the summer by hot temperatures and dry air.  In the fall, the conifers were
observed to have the largest carbon uptake of the season; presumably as soils
are warm, the air temperatures are not so hot, and the air is not so dry.
Leaf-level measurements suggest that the end of the growing season may be
induced by frost.  Measurements show that at temperatures below about -5 to
-10 degrees C, black spruce needles do not recover, and photosynthesis stops.

<H3>In Summary:</H3>
<p>
<OL>
<LI>The photosynthetic machinery of the boreal forest has considerably less capacity than the temperate forests to the south.  This is reflected in low photosynthetic and carbon drawdown rates which are associated with low transpiration rates.
<LI>The coniferous vegetation in particular follows a very conservative water use strategy.  The vegetation transpiration stream is drastically reduced by stomatal closure when the foliage is exposed to dry air, even if soil moisture is freely available.  This feedback mechanism acts to keep the surface evapotranspiration rate at a steady and surprisingly low level (less than 2 mm/day over the season).
<LI>The low evapotranspiration rates coupled with a high available energy during the growing season (the albedos are among the lowest observed over vegetated regions) can lead to high sensible heat fluxes and the development of deep planetary boundary layers, particularly during the spring and early summer.   These planetary boundary layers are often characterized by intense mechanical and sensible heat-driven turbulence.
<li>As far as we know, all current climate and numerical weather prediction models grossly overestimate evap-otran-spiration from the region.

The next few years will see analyses and publication of the results from this
field year.  Some limited visits back to the field are anticipated.
