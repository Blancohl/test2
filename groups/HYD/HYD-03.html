<B>Objectives:</B> To model the spatial and temporal distributions of critical snow pack properties and processes at scales up to about 1 square kilometer, several patches within the two intensive study sites, and to develop tools linking model predictions to remote sensing. The three principle objectives of the project are:
<UL>
<LI>to classify the Boreal forest biome based on the spatial distribution of tree stands, vegetation and soils, to establish land cover units which have similar attributes in the context of the upper and lower boundary conditions required by an energy and mass transfer model
<LI>to investigate methods for incorporating the effects of different tree canopy and stem characteristics into stand scale estimates of snow properties and surface energy exchange
<li>to identify the capabilities and limitations of remote sensing measurements to monitor the state of the snowpack.
</UL>
The study is focusing on the winter and thaw periods, and on the relatively small spatial scale (e.g. treestands and small watersheds).

<B>Objectives:</B><br>
The goal of this project is to model the spatial and temporal distributions of critical snow pack properties and processes at scales up to about 1 square kilometer and to develop tools linking model predictions to remote sensing. The three principal objectives of the project are:
<OL>
<LI>to classify the boreal forest biome based on the spatial distribution of tree stands, vegetation and soils, and to establish land cover units which have similar attributes in the context of the upper and lower boundary conditions required by energy and mass transfer models.
<LI>to investigate methods for incorporating the effects of different tree canopy and stem characteristics into stand scale estimates of snow properties and surface energy exchange.
<LI>to identify the capabilities and limitations of remote sensing measurements to monitor the state of the snow pack.

<B>Places and Times of Measurement:</B><br>
FFC-W 1994: SWE, snow pack properties, snow distribution, and canopy closure were measured at SSA-OJP, OA, and the Gamma flight line BP-110, as well as NSA-YJP, OJP, and OBS. Within canopy wind speed, wind direction, and subcanopy solar radiation were measured in SSA-OJP and OA.<br>
<IMG SRC="../../gifs/indent.gif">FFC-T 1994: SWE, snow pack properties, and snow distribution were measured at NSA-YJP, OJP and OBS. Canopy closure was measured at NSA: YJP and OBS. Subcanopy solar radiation was measured at NSA: YJP and OBS. Spectral reflectance measurements of the snow were made at a variety of incidence angles and azimuths at NSA-OBS.<br>
<IMG SRC="../../gifs/indent.gif">March 1995: The following measurements were made at NSA, OBS: snow distribution, snow pack properties, canopy closure, subcanopy solar and thermal radiation, snow surface and canopy temperatures, as well as within canopy wind speed, wind direction, air temperature and relative humidity. Additionally, we quantified radiative scatterers (needles and twigs) at 25, randomly selected, 1000 cc areas on five different trees to be incorporated into a canopy radiation model.
<p>
<br>
<B>Problems and Caveats:</B><br>
<OL>
<LI>Low values of wind speed collected during FFC-W in NSA, OJP are close to the threshold value for the instrument and therefore are not accurate. 
<LI>Studies have shown that densiometer derived canopy closure is not the most precise method of determining canopy closure, but that it is the best available "quick and easy" method. Data are considered approximate measures of canopy closure.
