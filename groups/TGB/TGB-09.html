<H2 align=center>TGB-9: Ambient Measurements of Ozone, Nitrogen Oxides and Non-Methane Hydrocarbons</H2>
<p>
<br>
<B>P.I.(s):</B> Hiromi Niki -- York University, Ontario
<P>
<B>Objectives:</B> An intensive ground based measurement campaign of ambient concentrations of biogenic and anthropogenic C2-C10 non-methane hydrocarbons at one of the Intensive Study Sites over the course of the 1994 experiment year, with full participation in the Intensive Field Campaigns (IFC) and possibly in the Focused Field Campaign during the spring thaw. A weekly to twice weekly hydrocarbon sampling schedule was intituted through the years 1993, 1994 and 1995 to provide season distribution data on these hydrocarbons.
<P>
<B>Location:</B> <A HREF="../../Sites1/SSA.html">SSA</A> (some <A HREF="../../Sites1/NSA.html">NSA</A>)<br>
<B>Sites:</B> young and old aspen, black spruce, pine.<br>
<B>Duration:</B> August 1993, mostly IFCs 1994.

<p>
<br>
<B>Objectives:</B><br>
<OL>
<LI>To identify and quantify the trace hydrocarbons present in the boreal forest, with a view towards discovering what pollutant sources impact upon the forest, and what oxidative processes are important in the boreal atmosphere.
<LI>To collect ambient samples in a manner that allows calculation of the flux of biogenic emissions using the gradient method.
</OL>
<p>
<br>
<B>Types of Data Collected:</B><br>
Ambient samples were collected in stainless steel canisters from two different heights above the forest canopy. Samples were returned to our laboratory in Toronto for analysis by GC-FID. Concentrations, in ppbV, are reported in BORIS for many nonmethane hydrocarbons. Other NMHC concentrations are available; contact TGB-9 directly for more information.
<p>
<B>Summary of Places and Times of Measurements:</B><br>
Old Black Spruce Site, Southern Study Area<br>
May 31 - June 5, 1994<br>
July 20 - July 24, 1994<br>
September 1 - September 7, 1994
<p>
Old Jack Pine Site, Southern Study Area<br>
June 7 - June 12<br>
July 27 - August 2<br>
September 9, 11, 15
<p>
Old Aspen Site, Southern Study Area<br>
August 4 - August 8<br>
September 12 - 14
<p>
<B>Known Problems and Caveats:</B><br>
Of the biogenic data, isoprene is absolutely the most reliable, alpha-Pinene is also fairly reliable. Other monoterpenes we continue to check, but we guess we are in the correct order of magnitude. Data for anthropogenic NMHCs reported we are quite confident in.
