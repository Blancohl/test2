<H2 align=center>TE-2: Autotrophic Respiration in Boreal Ecosystems</H2>

<B>P.I.(s):</B> Michael G. Ryan -- United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)<br>
<B>Collaborator(s):</B> Michael Lavigne -- Forestry Canada
<P>
<B>Objectives:</B> Because respiration increases exponentially with temperature, and because warming is expected to be the greatest at high latitudes, autotrophic respiration strongly affects dry-matter production and carbon storage in boreal forests. The research will:
<OL>
<LI>estimate instantaneous and annual fluxes of CO<sub>2</sub> from all respiration for the footprint of tower flux measurements in three ecosystem types (Spruce, Jack Pine, Aspen) at the two BOREAS study areas
<LI>test the use of tissue nutrient content as a general estimator of CO<sub>2</sub> flux from respiration
<LI>use paired comparisons at the two locations to determine whether respiration rates differ with genotype
<li>estimate an annual carbon budget for these sites (in cooperation with other scientists) to determine whether the ratio of respiration to photosynthesis differs among species and climates
</OL>
Results from these investigations will be used to develop better models for estimating CO<sub>2</sub> flux from autotrophic respiration, and clarify of autotrophic respiration in regulating productivity and carbon storage in ecosystems.

<br>
<B>Objectives:</B><br>
<OL>
<LI>to measure CO<sub>2</sub> efflux from autotrophic respiration from foliage, stems, branches, coarse roots, and fine roots in the major forest ecosystem types of the boreal forest
<LI>to develop relationships between autotrophic respiration, tissue characteristics (N, P, C, growth), and environment (temperature) to scale cuvette measurements to the ecosystem
<LI>to estimate instantaneous and annual fluxes of CO<sub>2</sub> from autotrophic respiration for the footprint of tower flux measurements
<LI>to use paired species comparisons at the two locations to determine whether respiration rates acclimate to different climates
<LI>to estimate an annual carbon budget for these sites (in cooperation with other scientists) to determine whether the ratio of respiration to photosynthesis differs among species and for different climates.
</OL>
<p>
<br>
<B>Types of Data Collected:</B><br>
<OL>
<LI>CO<sub>2</sub> efflux from tree stems and stem and air temperature (continuous diurnal measurements, 3-6 days per IFC) and wood growth, sapwood volume, and N, P, C, and starch and sugar content of sapwood after IFC-3.
<LI>CO<sub>2</sub> efflux from fine roots (< 2mm diameter) and foliage (at night), and tissue temperature, N, P, C, starch, sugar, mass, area (foliage) for each sample.
<LI>CO<sub>2</sub> efflux from branches and coarse roots and stem and air temperature and wood growth, sapwood volume, and N, P, C, and starch and sugar content of sapwood after IFC-3.
<LI>CO<sub>2</sub> efflux from foliage and foliage growth, C, N, P, starch, sugar, temperature.
<LI>Estimates of bole photosynthesis for aspen using shaded and unshaded chambers.
</OL>
<p>
<br>
<B>Summary of Places and Times of Measurements:</B><br>
Stem, foliage, and fine root respiration were collected at OBS, OA, OJP, YJP in NSA and OBS, OA, OJP, YJP, YA in SSA each IFC and also after IFC-3. Stem respiration was also collected at OBS, OA, OJP, YJP in NSA approximately every two weeks from 6/1 - 9/30. Stem respiration was also collected continuously at SSA-OBS between IFC-2 and IFC-3. Branch and coarse root respiration were measured only at NSA and only during IFC-3. Foliage respiration and foliage expansion was measured every 5-14 days from 5/28- 9/16 (depending on expansion rates) near NSA-Fen on aspen, black spruce, jack pine, alder, and birch.
